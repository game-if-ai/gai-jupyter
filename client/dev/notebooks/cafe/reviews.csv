0,"This pan is very versatile and very easy to clean. I use it regularly to make cookies, biscuits and reheating rolls. This has given my mini oven many additional uses. I would buy it again. ;",1
1,I Love the thinness of the turner at the bottom. Real easy to get under the eggs to flip them.,1
2,Rhinestones on hoodie were a nice surprise but they have already started becoming loose and getting lost. As a matter of fact one stone was  hanging off when it arrived. Be that as it may I will purchase again as the quality is very good and the jacket very beautiful. I had to obtain some fabric glue and I'll soon purchase some rhinestones to replace the lost ones.,1
3,"Bought this popper to replace my old West Bend Stir Crazy - the old version that is a bit bigger.  The lid was cracking pretty badly on that one after many years of use. When I saw this one at Target I was excited about the on/off switch and studier looking lid so I bought it immediately.  The first batch of popcorn popped about 2/3 of the kernels that I put in, so I tried again and only about 1/4 of kernels popped. Tried a third time and again only about 1/4 of the kernels popped.  What a disappointment!  I am returning it and just ordered my old faithful stir crazy.",0
4,"Great leather gift for 3RD anniversary. Only setback that it had no engraving,had to get a metal plate with engraving. otherwise ,GREAT",1
5,This is Great product.  Does not take up a lot of space and makes more space for your spices.,1
6,&#60;3,1
7,dishes are nice enough but had to order 3 times to get a set without broken pieces in the boxes. Lots of hassle......,0
8,Didn't realize this was plastic.. I assumed it would be glass for the price. Not sure if seller mentioned that or if I just missed it.,0
9,I would not order this product - it does not fit my Keurig.,0
10,I love it!,1
11,"These were poorly seasoned, in my opinion. My food stuck to the skillet and dutch oven almost immediately. What a let-down.",0
12,"Bought for our vacation home, they are perfect.  Great sizes, very sturdy, great colors too.  Ended up buying a second set for our main home.",1
13,"The bowls are beautiful, but definitely better to handwash them (over dishwasher). Hasn't been an issue for me though.",1
14,"I bought this item because I love the red color, but within a month or two of using it, the handle broke away from the paddle. I glued it back together with superglue and it lasted a bit longer, but ultimately it is just not good quality.  I would not recommend purchasing this item.  Go for something a bit more sturdy.",0
15,"Came out great, especially for my first home batch.  Follow directions, and you can't go wrong.  Flavor is a bit Guinness-like. Yum.",1
16,Love that you can clean the grates in the dishwasher,1
17,"Great product, all-natural, mailed in recyclable paper, plastic-free packaging, soft fabric, protects from heat",1
18,This unit appears to be defective. I used it four times and there is a stong burning paint smell every time. Also timer is only in minutes; no seconds option.  Amazon walked away from their Warranty responsiblity and e-mailed me to contact the manufacturer directly. No contact information or telephone number provided.<br /><br />I guess its buyer beware.  Good luck to all you buyers out there.,0
19,We only took out the electric can opener when we were waiting to get this one!  It works very smoothly and the mini pliers were a bonus although they weren't even necessary.,1
20,Really not stick free at all.  Had to return.,0
21,"My lunch box is great but it has already begun to tear inside which is going to lead to mildew growth. I really liked the product, but this is upsetting.",0
22,Just what I'm looking for. It really is 2.5 inches wide. We had the Johnnie Walker mold that we really find cool and I was looking to get more that are the same dimension. I first ordered the round mold that comes in a tray. It says it's 2.5 inches wide but it wasnt. I returned it and came across this. It is what it says it is. And best priced too so far here in Amazon. I'll order a few more boxes to giveaway as gifts. Thanks Live Inz!!!,1
23,"Owned one; it died.  Bought another; it died within a few months.  Great idea, but not good product.",0
24,"The Sistema Slimline Quaddie definitely has some issues, but it's still a good product. Unlike many of the previous users, I purchased this lunchbox for personal use (as an adult who packs her lunch for work every day).<br /><br />The first thing you should know  is that this box is pretty big. I'm not sure about the other customers using this box for packing their child's lunch, but that must be a hearty lunch! The second most important thing is that the four individual sections do not seal. They do keep food contained within the container, but they aren't airtight or watertight. Liquids will quickly leak out of the box, and bread will become stale if you make a sandwich the night before.  I own other Sistema products (love their containers for baked goods) and they all seal completely, but this isn't true of their lunch products. I haven't used the mini water bottle yet as it's just a bit too small for an adult. Cleaning is a bit awkward, but I haven't had any issues (the top sections sort of slide out of little grooves and can be washed separately from the main container which I usually hand wash because it collects water in the dishwasher).<br /><br />As a lunchbox, the Slimline Quaddie is excellent. It stores food easily and keeps your lunch items separate. I usually pack my food in individual ziplock bags then put them in the box. Thick liquids such as hummus seem to stay well contained without bags, although I usually tuck the entire box into a gallon sized plastic bag just in case. The bottom section is very spacious (although not very tall) and allows me to carry full sized silverware in my lunch. If you pack salads for lunch you will love the bottom section for packing and eating lettuce (loose lettuce with dressing and toppings in a ziplock). Having separate sections also encourages you to pack a balanced lunch.<br /><br />The only real problem that I have with the box is that it can be both too big and too small at the same time. I rarely manage to completely fill any of the sections, and larger  items like containers of yogurt won't fit anywhere. I haven't yet found plastic Tupperware small enough to fit in any of the sections.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with the box. It keeps food nicely contained and doesn't allow anything to get smashed. Can you do the same thing with individual Tupperware in a paper bag?  Yes, but it doesn't look as neat.etely fill any of the sections, and larger  items like containers of yogurt won't fit anywhere.

25,My straw was missing...otherwise it is as pictured.,1
26,This was way smaller than I thought it would be,0
27,This was a great gift for my boyfriends mom who is older and sits in her garden in the country most of the day. She had a hard time getting up until she got this seat,1
28,"This headboard does not fit the bed frame.  I ordered the 12 drawer bed frame and head board.  The frame is too wide to fit between the moldings on the front of the headboard.  If you cut the molding, you will expose the unfinished edge and it will look like crap.  If you have a standard metal bed frame, it might fit, I don't know.  But if you bought the 12 drawer frame, and probably the 6 drawer, it will not be wide enough.",0
29,The Chef's Choice 681 Cordless Electric Kettle has a very nice design and good  reviews. That's the reason why I bought it. Unfortunately it stopped working in 4 months. I've bought the kettle  in April and it stopped heating the water in August - very disappointed indeed.,0
30,"poor quality, guess you get what you pay for",0
31,"Terrific quality boards - it is great having 3 sizes of such good quality which can be used in diferent ways- meat, vegetables and cheese., etc. Totally pleased with this product, the packaging and quick Amazon delivery. Excellent as a gift as well as personal use. Having formerly used a glass board which dulled my knives with one use, I am so pleased to have bamboo which is so easy on my knives and is still really easy to keep clean. A great additon to my kitchen.",1
32,"Silicone baking cups are better for the environment since you can re-use them time after time. You simply line a muffun tin with these cups and bake away. Makes it easy to clean up your muffin tin too.The molds are super flexible, so it makes it easy to get cupcakes out. They are non stick, so you don't lose as much to the \\""wrapper\\"" as you would with paper molds. They wash easily in the dishwasher, so makes cleanup a breeze. The one problem I have is that I only have 12, so I'm gonna need to buy more to bake cupcakes for my daughter's birthday party. I do like that they are different colors, so I can bake different kinds of cupcakes within the same batch and know exactly what I put into them (provided I write down what I put  in them to begin with). These are handy to have and something that is useful. I also use these as ingredient holders when I'm preparing baking mixtures or recipes. They work well to hold my sugar, salt, butter, etc., until i'm ready to mix the ingredients together. I must admit, we also used these during sushi night to put soy sauce in since our soy sauce bowls broke during a move.",1
33,"These are perfect. I wanted to make homemade popsicles with the kids this summer and these really fit the bill. They are so simple to use. And I love how the handle has the shallow cup at the base, so when the kids are eating the popsicle it doesn't drip everywhere.",1
34,"I'm greatly disappointed with this purchase.  I got took!  I was expecting something like nearly new for $159.00, and what I received was an old very used coffee pot.  It takes 20 minutes to brew a pot, and the lettering is nearly worn off of the front.  The warming tray is very worn. This item would sell for no more than $20.00 at a flee market.  I'm disabled and my funds are precious and so I'm greatly disappointed. I though that this purchases seemed pricy but it was the only ones I could find and being through Amazon I trusted it was good.  At least it works!  First time I have been taken on Amazon!",0
35,My husband does the cooking and loves this fryer. Easy to use and clean.  The product works as advertised.<br />He uses it for all of his frying needs,1
36,"Holes are huge. End up with a cup of leaves. Not a fan.<br /><br />It was easy to open and reseal, and the holder to set it on afterwards is very convenient.",0
37,love this cutting board!  adds additional work space to my kitchen.,1
38,Nice coffeemaker & great value for the money.....,1
39,I use this with the food saver containers and fewer food items go to the compost pile :) ... Thank you for making a good product,1
40,Love to have an extra bowl. The handle was a little different than the original bowl but this one is great anyway.,1
41,"The handle broke off while I was washing the pan in the sink after only 2 weeks of use. It worked great while it lasted, but it seems like the handle was just glued on with super glue.",0
42,Awesome shaker cup!! This vertually eliminates all powder clumps in you protien. it seals tight and I have yet to have one leak. Very relyable product and worth every penny.,1
43,For years my husband wanted to try his hand at making beer. So I bought him this stuff for Christmas. He loves making different kinds so I wanted to get plenty of bottles. These are perfect. Some of the process takes place in the bottle and these make allowance for expansion as the beer ferments.,1
44,"I wish I had paid closer attention to the negative reviews, they are mostly valid.  I bought this product because of the name brand and because it has an on/off switch.  Don't let the name Cuisinart fool you, most of their products are good, pricey, but good.  This one is not good.  All the popcorn does not pop, some is left in the popper when it is done, even when I leave it on for an extra long time and risk burning the kernels.  In addition to that, unpopped kernels come out during the whole popping process and I used a premium popping corn.  And, yes, the popcorn and kernels fly all over the place and I used a great big bowl.",0
45,My husband gave me one of these mixers several years ago and I love it.  I have given them as engagement presents to all (3) my granddaughters and they are so appreciative.  Great product!  Grandma,1
46,This scale is way too complicated for what I was looking for.  There's a book with codes for different items.  I thought you'd be able to type a name in and it would generate all the information.  I've used it once.,0
47,"These ceramic pans by Chantal are amazing.  Solidly constructed, heavy, heat-distributing bottom, sturdy handle, and best of all, the ceramic interior coating.  It works better than my All Clad non-stick surface, probably lasts longer, is a cinch to clean up, and even has a Chantal ceramic cookware cleaner that dissolves the toughest baked or burned on food in a flash.  It is my &#34;go to&#34; pan for just about everything.  I can't praise it enough.  I own two 10&#34; pans, paying only $60.00 at another chef's site (hint), but they are worth twice the price.  Buy them will they last!",1
48,"This Pump will pump you up, literally.",0
49,For an old fashioned ice cream social party!,1
50,This is my 3rd one.  It was my fault that my second one died -  I gave it a super cleaning job and burned the element.,1
51,This may be my own fault but i thought this was an actual straw that glowed in the dark. This however was a straw with a glow stick glued to the outside.....was kinda let down.....,0
52,"I LOVE IT! It's a very nice cast-iron pan. I've been using it as a grill too (over a butane stove), as well as making Teppan-food. (otherwise known as hibachi in America, I dunno why).",1
53,Used once - no difference - waste of money,0
54,I wish I had researched these pans further. I found that I could have purchased directly from the vendor at half the cost and shipping.<br /><br />The pans are awesome. Cakes came out perfectly.,0
55,"My husband cooks more than I do. He loves this Cuisinart and all that he can do with it. Very happy, bought it for him a few years ago and it is still going strong.",1
56,"Unfortunately, this product does not work for me! I wanted it for spraying olive oil. The vendor was FANTASTIC and sent me a second one after I told him that the oil came out in a STREAM not SPRAY. However, the second one did the same thing! It might work as a spray for vinegar--I don't know--I only tried it for oil. Sorry! It just didn't work like the pump olive oil sprayers I have had in the past.",0
57,"I expected recipes with this item, there were none, OH, but of course I would have to order a recipe book, and that is not<br />what I am going to do, so I am returning the whole unit. The enclosed literature tells me how it  goes together, but that is all. And with any<br />other item I have ever ordered, there is always an invoice inclosed with the item ordered. There was not one in this package. The worst<br />thing about this unit is, it is made in China!!",0
58,The top is well put together but the cart could be a bit beefier.  The tin seems a bit thin.  It is difficult to load the popcorn maker with the pre-measured packs but that is just the nature of all of these.  It is a good size and pops enough popcorn for 5-6.  Love the tray warmer!  It was a bit of a challenge putting it together as the thin walls required a little coaxing to get them in line but it seems solid enough.,1
59,"The description stated there was only a BB size dent.  There were actually 2 BB sized dents and the rim was also dented/ bent (that could have happened during shipping)  I could have almost overlooked the dents, but this tray is so thin & flimsy, it could never sit level on any surface.  It is VERY warped & looks terrible & cheap.  I had to return it.  The only reason it got 2 stars in stead of one, is that the simplicity of the design is attractive.",0
60,doesn't cut easily.,0
61,gift,0
62,"this si a great idea and its time has come takes a while to get used to them but they really do get a good grip on food you are eating without making you mess. I suggest you don't squeeze real hard, sometimes the food slips till ya get the hang of it",1
63,Received quickly price is good,1
64,"Our grandchild loves to help out in the kitchen, so now that she has her own cutting board and plastic knife, she can work side by side with her mom creating yummy dishes.  The cutting board is a perfect size for little hands.",1
65,I was excited to find these.  One of our camping friends has some and my husband loves them.  I found these and now my husband has his very own.  Great for use by kids and adults the same.,1
66,These are terrible.  Parts are no longer available.  they used to sell a $7 gear that always strips in the motor housing.  now they will only sell you a new motor.  Save your money.,0
67,"Worth the money if you just want to make good rice. Does not have any other features that you may find useful, such as a keep warm setting, vegetable steaming option, etc. I love the easy clean-up and its small size so I can keep it on the counter. So far the non stick surface looks good, I have not seen any of the flaking that others are writing about. The pan in which the rice cooks feels a bit cheap, but it does the job and it does it well.",1
68,It really works.  I've used it numerous times and it's always thawed my items perfectly.  Have used it many days when I forgot to get something out for supper,1
69,"These are fantastic!  I even bought 2 more sets.  They are great for juice and sweet smoothies.  Both release easily from the mold after a quick moment under hot tap water.  Fun for the kids, and me too!",1
70,"The tritan plastic is great.  Unbreakable & stays clear.  I use both the 12 oz white wine and the 20 oz red wine glasses.  Yes there have been some comments that the stem is too wobbly.  It is just slightly flexible but works fine.<br />There are also comments about the sharp drinking edge and this is a concern but easily repairable.  Only the inside edge is a problem.  Put some masking tape around the outside to protect from scratches.  Take a 1&#34; x 2&#34; piece of 150 grit sandpaper and with your thumb sand down the inside sharp edge only.  Then take a 1&#34; x 2&#34; piece of 400 wet dry and polish the inside edge.  Makes a world of difference on sensitive lips!!  Just love these glasses now.  Just fill with your favorite wine and enjoy without the risk of broken glass around the pool, on the tile deck, etc..<br /><br />Purchased mine from &#34;Clearly Acrylic&#34; who was a wonderful, prompt supplier that responded quickly to email questions with helpful responses.  Recommend highly purchasing from them.",1
71,"I received a Cusinart food processor as house warming gift. (It is a different model.) It broke down at the very first time I used it. I paid shipping and sent it back for repair. Then I got a letter that asked me to pay for the repair. I called multiple times and they said that it was not under warranty. Two out of three customer service representatives were very rude. They insisted that customers should pay as far as it is not under warranty \\""regardless if it broke down at the first time or on the first day\\"". That tells you they have no commitment to their product quality and how relentlessly they treat their customers. I would never buy another Cusinart product and return any Cusinart gift. Or I will just tell friends never to give me a Cusinart product.",0
72,Easy to use and worked perfectly. It is exactly what I wanted. After reading many machine reviews this one had the best performance. I give it 5 stars.,1
73,I love being able to use the reusable cups for ground coffee. I just bought some roasted beans from Costa Rica and Love having this option to enjoy my coffee.,1
74,"I bought it without thinking my yarn was bigger, so it doesn't fit well and work well. Wish I had bought a bigger one, but the reg. yarn fits in it well so I will enjoy using it.",1
75,Very nice and compact.  Works great !,1
76,"This product was junk.  The description of the item did not say that it needed assembling.  When my husband went to assemble it, he found that parts were drilled incorrectly.  When he attempted to drill the holes correctly, the material split making it impossible to use.  Also, when he was hammering items together as directed, the wood split.  I sent the company an e-mail requesting my money back and the dissatisfaction that we had the headboard. To date, I have heard nothing from them. I would not recommend this company to any one.",0
77,"I have a couple different blenders; a Vita-Mix I've had for years, another very cheap one and now this BlendTec.  To me this Blendtec is quieter than the other blenders I have. It does a very good job of blending. I programmed the #2 button so that when the machine is on all I have to do is just press #2 but before the blender is through I also like to hit the far right \\""faster\\"" button (can't remember the actual name of the button) just to make the end product creamier which will make it run up to 50 seconds longer but I just hit the off button after about ten seconds.  I am very pleased with this blender. I don't need a tamper! It does not rag on my nerves as it runs like the others do.  I usually do green smothies with it so have not made anything with ice chopped up yet.   All in all a great product! I got my blender through Amazon.",1
78,Great mold! I am using them for soaps (they produce a thinner bar) to gift to valued customers. I have businesses ordering these soaps as gifts for their customers! Would make a perfect candy bar.,1
79,Not able to use this with pancakes.  A little bummed since that is why I bought it.  Batter stuck to it everywhere:(,0
80,Great,1
81,"I purchased this item recently by seeing 650 Wats, 10 button option.<br /><br />In first day when we put plug somg come from inside and it put any quantity more then 1/2 LB it won't give proper results nor it's work blends.<br /><br />We have spend lot of time to base with this Item.",0
82,when i got the coffee maker plugged it in and it didn't work at all so i sent it back,0
83,It's pretty!<br />My daughter really likes it.,1
84,"I read all the reviews and picked the Sunbeam because of that & the great price. I was very disappointed when I used the kettle. As soon as the water boiled it would leak out of the bottom of the kettle. Not a little leak but a ton of water. Not sure if I just got a bad one. Not gonna risk it, will purchase a different model.",0
85,use less water to make it more firm and put oil or spray with pam before use. love this product! used for a neurology health fair!,1
86,WORKS GREAT<br />will buy more of there product.  have there one cup pot. work great. would tell others to buy,1
87,"I bought two of these mugs,1 black & 1 grey. They both have the same problem,that being they're poorly designed. The lids screw on but after a few minuets of hot coffee they warp leaving you with coffee dripping down your chin and another stain-resistant shirt stained. I donated the two cups to the local landfill. Ordered another kind from amazon but the results are the same. Another stained shirt, another review.",0
88,"Good quality. Keeps my coffee warm for the morning drive to work, but not so hot that you can't drink it for a hour.",1
89,"This is the best masher we have ever used,made in USA we will never need to look again as this will outlast us.Very well made  we love it,Thanx for checking in and for carrying such good products.  Gary",1
90,Great wok.<br />Good construction<br />Large surface area<br />I am so glad I got this wok and I do enjoy cooking with it,1
91,"Only one cup arrived (advertised as 12). I knew they wouldn't be particularly high quality, but one of these cheap tumblers is most definitely NOT WORTH the money (~$14.12).",0
92,"I did a lot of research to find a decent toaster at a decent price. Deciding on this was a big mistake. The 1100 watts was misleading as it was very slow to toast. I had it replaced under warrantee, and that wasn't much better. Then, within about 5 months, the catch mechanism broke (for the lever which holds the toast down) as others had reported. For me, a total waste of time and money.  I just ordered a Kitchen Aid, thought I should pass this along.",0
93,The teacups and saucers are just what we were looking for.  They are very good quality.,1
94,I sent an e-mail when I received this item. The box was opened and there was only one filter in it. There was supposed to be two. Do you intend to do anything about it? The other items received were fine.,0
95,"Stay away from this product. I bought the Melitta 10 Cup thermal Coffee Maker Model # 46894 because I was looking for a 10 cup and for the most part it had good reviews, even though I saw some reviews that claimed it did not keep the coffee warm. Well now I know why. The warmer plate automatically turns off after brewing the coffee rather than the 2 hour auto-off feature. In addition to that the water reservoir leaked and left puddles on the counter top. This purchase was a total waste of my time and energy. I sent an e-mail to Melitta customer service and they never responded. If I could give it less than one star I would.",0
96,"After purchasing these and using them once, the molds don't hold their form anymore. This bottoms do not sit flush in the pan/griddle and egg runs out unless you hold your fingers on the mold the entire time! What a disappointment!",0
97,"Initially the anti-fatigue rugs seemed like it was a great purchase.  I bought two and they arrived on a Friday.  I put one in front of the kitchen sink and the other in front of the range.  I enjoyed their cushioning effect over the weekend, but on Monday morning as I rinsed my coffee cup before leaving for work, my high heel went through the cover - a hole right in my new rug! The same things happened the next morning - the rug cover cannot even support my 125 lbs!  Very disappointing purchase, unless you plan to wear only soft-soled, flat shoes.",0
98,I bought this for a colleague who lives in Geneva and is a baker.  She can't get it there and asked me to bring.  She was very excited and happy to get it.,1
99,"Works great! I was skeptical when I first opened it because it was plastic and very light-- It seemed cheap. I couldn't be more wrong. The light weight makes it easy to put up and take out. It's also very easy clean up. I've only made zucchini noodles so far, but I plan on making curly fry sweet potatoes tonight!",1
100,I recently moved and wanted to host thanksgiving at the new place. I received it in a million little pieces...broken. It was I a box with no bubble-wrap...nothing. Of course it was going to break...!,0
101,"This is a shoddy product. Difficult to operate, does not achieve what it says it will.  Not comparable to other As Seen on TV products. Smaller version is much more efficient.  Truly a waste of money.    Not recommended at all.",0
102,Does not crush the garlic sufficiently--lacks force.,0
103,"French company. Shipped from Japan. Made in China.<br /><br />I have an older, larger version of this pitcher from Arc/Luminarc. The old one has a lovely soft plastic cap which fits tightly and allows you to shake the contents or even turn the pitcher upside down to mix without losing any liquid.<br /><br />The new cap is a flimsy annoying hard plastic that doesn't fit tightly in the top. In the closed setting, if you shake it, liquid spurts out the top and if you turn it over...disaster! This means I can't shake my drinks before serving, which is important for drinks that separate, such as lemonade with crushed mint.<br /><br />Even worse, while this plastic cap provides no useful seal it is also a PAIN to remove.<br /><br />I love the older versions of this jug and am DESPERATELY looking for some of the older ones with softer caps. The new ones are just junk. If I find a source I will post here.<br /><br />Edited to add that after a long hunt, I found a perfect replacement! [[ASIN:B003GY7Q7W Bormioli Rocco Frigoverre Jug with Hermetic Lid, 17-Ounce]]  This wonderful glass jar has a top that does seal completely, though you have to take the extra step of sealing it by turning the inner ring on the lid while holding the outer ring in place. I liked the old soft plastic cap on the Quadro better, but given that it no longer exists, I'm at least happy to find a well-made product that  has a real airtight seal and can be turned upside down to shake.",0
104,"This leaves lots of us popped kernels, and if you increase the time hoping to pop more the corn burns.",0
105,"I have had very poor experience with EuroPro the manufacturer of this specific blender. Although this blender looks cool and has cool name \\""Ninja\\"" if you want reliability get a blender made by a company that has a good rep such as Oster, KitchenAid, Hamilton Beach even over-priced Vita Mix.<br /><br />A blender is not a smart flat screen or tablet or smart phone. It simply crushes material until it is pureed. When blending something the key parts are the blade and the motor's capability. Multiple speeds are fine but really not critical to the process. Some of the best blenders are not the most expensive.<br /><br />The last thing is to have a blender fail when it is needed.",0
106,Pulled this out to make my first tortillas... not bad until the third press and I could see whatever this is plated or painted with chipping off into my dough... I researched so many and the reviews for this one looked wonderful... not sure what product they received but I can't imagine they like metal shavings or whatever it is peeling off in their food... had to use parchment paper or it stuck really bad... pressed like crazy and the tortilla still wasn't any flatter than using a board... I'd love to return it but I think it would cost me more than it's worth... bummer!,0
107,I have wanted a whistling tea kettle for ages and this is a really good one and priced well.  Goodie,1
108,"Why didn't I look at the reviews first? This toaster is THE worst toaster I've ever had. Often it toasts ONE side of each slice of bread. Also, if you toast a second set of toast shortly after the first set it ALWAYS burns it.  It might as well not have a heat setting dial at all, because setting the dial makes absolutely no difference. J-U-N-K. Seriously, how hard is it to get a toaster right? Where is the quality control?",0
109,"Cuts pizza like a charm, very quick & is SOO easy to clean. That was my main concern. Rinses right off!",1
110,I purchased these last year and have been using them daily.  They are fantastic for taking apart a fresh chicken and strong enough to break bone rather easily.,1

The next set did not have blank spots, but the hand painting looked like a 10 year-old had done it on their fist day on the job.  There were also blank spots in the designs where cups had clearly rubbed on each other before the paint dried.  Neither set should have ever passed QC, especially at over 10$ a cup.

The \\""pork\\"" setting only goes to 165 well done, whichis a full 30 degrees under what I cook a pork butt to. This leaves me with a plain jane temp readout thermometer, whick is all I really wanted anyway.<br />Here's the kicker. With the module sitting on the grill table, in the sun, the readout fails! I have to take the unit into the house to cool down and then plug it back in to the probe to get a reading. This thing does not do what it is designed for. Maybe I was expecting too much for my money. It is junk.",0

135,"So many of us are looking for a way to brew a great tasting cup of coffee with the same convenience we have when you using K-cups, though without the high cost.  The SySrion-Cup is larger than other reusable coffee filter which lets me brew a stronger flavored cup of coffee.  Every now and then I would get a few pieces of coffee grounds, but I get this with K-cups too. The filter will hold 3-5 Tablespoons of coffee. With the filter having the ability to hold more or less coffee grounds I was able to brew different strengths of coffee that appealed to the different taste buds in my household. I like strong coffee and I used four tablespoons.  This reusable cup works differently than other similar cups. To use this cup you have to take out the K-cup Holder Assembly, and then place the SySrion-cup where you removed the holder. Then you fill the filter cup with coffee, place it inside the filter holder and screw the lid on. The reusable cup is easy to clean. Pre ground coffee works great in this filter, but espresso grind is too fine and does not work in this filter. That is the only thing that I wish was different since I like an espresso once in a while. Keep in mind that this reusable cup does not work in the new 2.0 Keurig brewer, but does work in most of their other brewers.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

142,"I recently celebrated my first year anniversary -- of being an Amazon reviewer. A special occasion like this deserves a special celebration, so I wanted to do more than just crack open a six-pack and get woozy on my living room couch.<br /><br />I wanted to crack open a six-pack and get woozy on my living room couch in STYLE. So I tried learning about beer appreciation that went beyond the cost of a case and the color on the cans.<br /><br />My favorite part of beer is the hops, so I figured this kit would be a dream. I'd be transported -- as though some bottle-fermented Calgon had taken me away -- to the Bavarian highlands, or sunny California, or whereever else hops are grown and harvested. Tahiti? Poughkeepsie? Outer Mongolia? That's why I needed the kit.<br /><br />Sadly, it appears to be the brewing process that renders hops so delicious. The hops included in this kit are earthy, bitter, grassy and have no business accompanying a nice cheese pizza or plate of hot wings. You'd have thought I'd learned my lesson after the disaster tasting Live Cultured Yeasts of the World a few years back, but no. I bought this kit, too.<br /><br />On the bright side, I do think it's developed my palate. If ever there's a danger of lemon-soaked sweatsocks contaminating the world's escarole supply, I'll be able to tell what's been tainted. Just don't ask me to boil it down and chug the juice over a plate of bratwurst. I'd sooner go back to the yeast.",1

It is a piece of junk!",0

After standing in line for 45 minutes at the Post Office, I was advised that I was standing in the wrong line, and things went downhill from there.

I picked this make and model from the reviews written by others who have this machine, and I wanted to add my review to the list.  I love this machine!  I literally took it out of the box, wiped it off with a dishrag, plugged it in, made the batter from the recipe included inside, and made my first batch of perfect, fantastic tasting pizzelles, the first ones I have had in probably 40 years.  I wish I had not waited so long to get one.  My family, who had no idea what pizzelle's were, absolutely love them!  I also love that this machine has no temperature settings to fuss with.  I have made both vanilla and chocolate pizzelles and I just count to 30 after I close the top, and they come out perfect.  The baker was well packaged, in perfect shape, ready to go.  I am extremely happy with this baker and highly recommend it!",1
154,"ok, now that I've had this for almost half a year, I feel I can accurately review it!<br /><br />Works great.  As other users have mentioned, you do have to add some time to reheat things due to low wattage.  But so what?  I really don't mind that it takes 72 seconds to heat up my coffee as opposed to 60 seconds.<br /><br />The microwave is easy to clean and sturdy and that's all that matters to me.  The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the additional preset features are laid out in the weirdest way (presumably because the microwave has no number pad) making them a pain in the butt to use.<br /><br />However, if you're like me and don't mind just spinning the dial once more for extra time, you'll love this product.",1
155,"We have used this of course to make crepes (takes some getting used to using the wooden tools- but keep at it.  Our first few crepes looked more like Swiss cheese, we've gotten way better at it now!)  We also use it to make French toast, pancakes and gas house eggs.  Next up we are going to try making tortillas.  The recipe book that comes with it has lots of great ideas.  We like it a lot because it is easy to use and doesn't take a lot of oil which makes things a lot healthier.",1

I'm getting better though, as I'm on Amazon tonight browsing for a new can opener, and you can be sure it won't be another Black and Decker. I think they should stick to making tools for the handyman and forget appliances. We had a B &D toaster oven several years back that performed almost as miserably as this can opener.<br /><br />On the positive side it does have a nice sleek design and looks good on the kitchen counter. The knife sharpener is a good feature and does work. The \\""one touch\\"" idea would be great if only the can would stay in the cutter. Ditto for the \\""tall can\\"" idea. Great, but the cans keep falling out. Very few cans of any size have ever stayed in and gone completely around.  In order to even start, one must peel the label from the can first or it gets chewed up and causes a wad of paper at the cutter which in turn also causes the can to slip out. Other times this \\""beast\\"" is a tease and only partially opens a can. You wind up with 3 or 4 cuts in the lid and the can opener cannot be persuaded to go around again and cut through completely.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer who wanted a minus star to rate this with, except I would like about minus 5! If you see this appliance in a store, run the other way. Do NOT waste your hard earned dollars on a purchase.",0

I really like how the insulated tumblers keep the outside of the cup dry ,without sweating, no matter what temperature the liquid is inside. Overall, these are really nice tumblers.",1

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the food jar kept my soup hot--not warm, for almost 3 hrs!  While I have not yet tested the extent of the guarantee, I believe that this food jar will live up to its expectations.  It already has in my book!

They're beautifully designed...visually.  I thought I'd keep one at work and one to carry around with me in a large tote that doubles at work and gym bag.<br /><br />Functionally, their performance is a joke.  These things leak.  Period.<br /><br />At first I thought it was me not screwing the lids on tight enough--but am I really not screwing the lid on tight enough every single time I use these bottles?  I don't seem to have this ridiculous issue with my Nalgene and Rubbermaid water bottles.  Let me reiterate that point--I'm a hiker, a gym enthusiast, and am in general always going from one place to another with a bottle of water in my hand or in my bag.  I've NEVER had a Nalgene or Rubbermaid or Sigg leak on me, my bag, my belongings or devices (yes, you heard me, devices).  Yet every time this gorgeous but useless bottle does anything but sit on the very flat surface of my desk, everything's wet.  And that's after screwing the lid on so tight I think I'm going to break it.<br /><br />Still, just to make sure, I got both of them in into the kitchen, filled them both with water, screwed the lids on TIGHTLY, gently laid them on their sides on a towel and returned about 15 minutes later.<br /><br />Yup.  Leakage.<br /><br />So Aladdin, it really is you, it's not me.<br /><br />I'm going to try to return these from the retailer where I bought them (alas I've lost the receipt).  How does this make it through your product development cycle--You guys are normally pro's at this kind of thing.  How on earth do you let a design get to market (& so widely sold, no less) that fails in its basic function to carry water from one place to another without leaking.<br /><br />I'm fascinated.  I really want to know.<br /><br />Until then, I'm sticking with with my other bottles...I even have free promo giveaway bottles I've thrown into bags without this kind of issue.

They just decide by themselves how to use the pictures one uploads. I got a set of mugs with 2 times the same photos on each mug, and all really tiny, and the pictures are drawn in length, giving my family members egg heads and pear heads. My Mom looks like a red-blur ghost. Not to mention that the photo of her was inverted. The only good thing I can say is that the mugs have no leaks. I want them to reimburse me, as they promised they would do, if the quality was unsatisfactory.... but now they ask me to air-mail these mugs back to them for a refund at my cost!. The cost alone of that will be way more than they cost to buy... a mystery to me how the manufacturer managed to ship them over so cheaply.... from Great Britain nonetheless!

Forget about bagels- even on the bagel setting, it completely chars the top black while the middle area is soft and luke-warm. It's basically a top loading &#34;toaster oven.&#34;<br />Love the feel & look of it- but the engineers obviously never tried their toaster after building it- total crap.",0

219,"I bought two of these, one for each home. Both failed, one within the warranty and one just outside. It was over $300 to repair the one that failed at my expense.,<br /><br />Now the one repaired a few months ago has crashed again but is outside warranty and the CPU they replaced failed again after one cleaning cycle. They would not honor their repair. Given we live in each home for six months a year, three failures on two machines means this is a lemon. DO NOT BUY this machine!",0
220,"Bought this for my brother, a chef who was looking for a compact slicer, specifically for slicing duck breasts and stuff like that in a small work area.  Turns out he loves it, the super thin blade is a plus on tender meats. I also loved the unusual handle for this type of detail work, perfect instead of a beefy handle.  The flexibility aspect is more of a knock-on effect of the thin blade, not what I bought it for.  A filet knife is way more flexible.",1

223,I bought this for a fondue night. I made a cheese fondue and then a chocolate one right after. Clean up in between the 2 was easy. The forks are decent quality and found them better then another set I ordered online (but I wouldn't recommed putting them in the dishwasher just to keep their look). The temperature settings are great and didnt burn either the cheese or the chocolate. I would recommend this. Oh I used this to feed about 8 people.,1

226,"Anyone who, like me, is new to cooking with stainless steel needs to do a thorough job researching their options before buying. This is a great set, but if I had to do it over, I would probably go for anodized or nonstick just because of my personal preferences. As another reviewer states, food tends to stick and some things just can not be cooked in the stainless pans, like fried potatoes. Forget trying to cook with very little oil or just cooking spray as you can with nonstick. The pans tend to discolor and stain so a special cleaner like barkeeper's friend is required. I'm sure these will be extremely durable and they do distribute heat really well. I contacted their customer service with my questions about this set and an actual person contacted me and exchanged several e-mails - personally answering my questions in a timely manner. I was very impressed by their customer service! Overall, I'd recommend this product, but only to those who know they want stainless and are more adept at cooking with it than I am!",1

231,If I could give it less that 1 star I would. This product is junk. I bought it specifically so I could primarily use it yo brew pots of coffee and also make single cups using K-Cups. I tried using K-Cups from Starbucks. The coffee maker ounces the holes as it should during the loading process and after switching it to single cup K-Cup mode the machine sounds like the water is boiling and gurgling and buzzing...but next to no coffee comes out. I wasted 3 Starbucks K-Cups because the customer service person said I probably loaded the K-Cup improperly...so I tried a few more times. The next time I called the CS person suggested I try making a single cup using ground coffee and then she also told me Green Mountain K-Cups work better then others.The ground coffee worked so I tried a Green Mountain K-Cup. It didn't work. Same bubbling and gurgling and buzzing. The next CS person said it sounds like the K-Cups are not being punctured correctly and I should send it in for repair. I didn't buy a coffee maker that needs repair right out of the box. I want my money back. They offered to replace it with a new one for but I would have to pay $15 for shipping. I'm not paying $15 to get another piece of junk. I'm going to try to get a refund from where I bought it so I won't have deal with garbage.,0

Kitchen Aid gives you a special metal tray to put the popcorn on...and it still doesn't work. a single serve bag, 3 and a 1/2 minutes later is half burned and half unpopped. It's incredible how awful this thing is. And the convection oven? Baked goods are still uneven. And the timing is not reduced by using that feature.

We also bought a kitchen aid dishwasher. it takes hours to run and stuff isn't that clean.",0

237,"I read somewhere that by drinking lemon infused water in the morning jump starts your metabolism. So I decided to give that a try. I am not sure if that works, but I can say that this infuser works perfectly making the lemon water. I just chunk up the lemon , fill the infuser tube, put it back on the jar and fill with water. Now, I tried drinking the water straight away, you don't et much flavor that way, plus it's not really cold, and I like my water icy. There really isn't much room for standard ice cubes, so I put the bottle in the refrigerator for an hour or so, and the water is chilled and the lemon flavor is more pronounced. Watermelon makes an incredible flavored water as well, and the flavor comes through right away. I believe this will be awesome to make all types of citrus or melon infused water with. And although they are not in season, I am betting fresh ripe strawberries would work wonderfully as well.<br /><br />Vendor Supplied",1

I will need it to strain some frozen black raspberries I have but right now I am making this most amazing coffee ice cream in my new Cuisinart ice cream freezer.  I do not drink coffee so use Starbuck's roasted beans and keep them in the freezer.  The smell is heavenly, don't use some exotic flavors, just plain.  When I make the ice cream, I smash them with a hammer, about 4 tablespoons to 6 cups milk/cream.  Then I infuse them in the hot milk for an hour (before I temper it with eggs).  And then what?  I have to strain all the ground up coffee out.  3 or 4 thicknesses cut in about a 5 inch square and fitted into a regular medium strainer with a handle does the trick.",1

Note that these are issues with the design of the grinder assembly in terms of its ability to handle sausage meat.  The sausage feed tubes are just ordinary, plastic, tapered tubes.

242,"I have had this coffee maker for over a year.  For the first few months it made awesome coffee.  The carafe keeps the coffee hot/warm all day which is great.  But, unfortunately this coffee maker has a few flaws that takes away all its redeeming qualities.  1)The carafe is impossible to clean.  It has a tiny opening up top that we can get only a baby bottle brush in.  When I look in through the top, there are stains in there I cannot remove and I am never sure how clean the carafe really is.  2)The lid to the carafe that prevents spilling and coffee backing up is not cleanable.  There is a little ball in there that can be removed/clean, but there are little plastic balls in there that are not accessible nor are the cleanable.  3)Because of its lack of clean-ability, over time the quality of the coffee deteriorates.",0

She called me at the end of the day and said there'd been no delivery. I called Teleflora and asked what happened. They said that they did not have access to delivery information and would not tell me which florist had been used for the order. They also said deliveries were backed up for Valentine's Day and that they would try to deliver again tomorrow. I agreed to having it delivered the following day even though that was no longer Valentine's Day. At the end of the following day my mother called me again, still no delivery. Now that's inexcusable! You're a floral company right? That delivers flowers? So, how come no flowers were delivered? I called Teleflora, once again, same song and dance: We do not have and cannot give you, the customer the delivery and florist information. So, I canceled the order and had a refund issued to my credit card. I've been told that my refund should appear in the next few days.

Using imported (hard) Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, it requires SO much effort to make a very small quantity of shaved cheese! I tried running the cheese up and down on the same side. I tried turning the grate over (I think one side is supposed to be for a finer grate) and for me it was just even harder to grate.

So far I have used only white rice so I cannot comment on brown rice or the steamer part as I bought it specifically for white rice. It does get slightly (and I do mean slightly) brown in the center of the bottom. When you stir the rice, it is not noticeable. It makes the best white rice. I love the \\""set it and forget it\\"" feature of this product. I don't have to worry about it while I cook the rest of the meal. If it gets done first, then the warm feature keeps it at a good temperature.",1

The one handed operation is certainly convenient, but they will give your thumbs a real workout.

Be careful when filling them that you unscrew them between the two lower metal cylinders and NOT between the metal and plastic (both joints are threaded).  The plastic threads broke off from one of mine after only a couple of refills, so now I am down to just one.  There is no grind coarseness adjustment, but the preset medium grind is good enough.",1

338,"I received an email shortly from Ozeri asking for me to write a review for this item, well here you go Ozeri. You're selling the same item as the number one ranked food scale (which is identical to this), & you both end up soliciting for 5 star reviews. Sorry, but when I'm looking for items, I don't want the review to be tampered with, and I want unbiased, honest responses from customers. When you look at the 800+ reviews on this item, it becomes apparent that it was deliberate.<br /><br />If Ozeri wants more people to buy their item then maybe<br /><br />A) they should stop soliciting for reviews<br />B) not bribe people with a stupid pepper grinder in order to get 5 stars<br />C) actually make something rather than re-badge some Chinese-made food scale they bought for pennies. Why do I say this? Because it's the same identical food scale as the number one & it becomes obvious they are just relabeling them from some wholesaler.<br /><br />I cannot speak for the quality of the scale, but I can say that it is just a generic scale. Do not go by the reviews which are clearly not objective. Look for ones that where the reviews haven't been hijacked & you'll see that the top ones are not necessarily the best for the price.<br /><br />Here's the email they sent me below:<br /><br />\\""If it is not too much to ask, please help us by writing a short review on Amazon.com.

If you go to a mass merchandiser (KMart) or a department store (Sears), you can't find anywhere near as good of a knife set as this one, especially at such a low price.  The knives are dense, sturdy, and well-weighted.  This is the perfect set for the person that not only wants a decent set of knives, but also wants a really stylish addition to their kitchen.  I have a set of these and, since none of my friends are professional chefs, everyone always wants to know how I could afford such a nice set.  It's really a great deal, and you'll use those shears more than you know!

350,"I love cooking pizza, and there's nothing better than a home made one fresh out of the oven.  However finding an oven that'll do a great job of making the crust rise, bubble the cheese, and give you a nice crispy crust has been a challenge.  The Deni Pizza oven was the closest thing I'd found to the perfect oven, however now that it's been discontinued, I was looking for a replacement.  Given all the reviews on the Pizzaz oven I thought I'd give it a try.  Unfortunately it doesn't live up to it's billing.  It may be fine for frozen pizza, (I wouldn't know; I don't eat frozen pizza),  but cooking a fresh pizza is a bust.  The heating element simply isn't big enough to heat the whole 12\\"" pizza.  It doesn't reach all the way to the centre for starters.  Also, the tray spins too slowly giving the dough and cheese too much time to cool off before going through another heating pass.  The mozzarella never really melts to a golden brown, just melted white.  The very centre of the pizza (2 inch diameter) doesn't even get that from the top.<br />I tried various settings and times, going as high as 16 minutes.  However this just over crisped the bottom, and the top cheese still wasn't melted.<br />All this means I have to give it a failing grade for fresh pizza.  Lots of the reviews refer to frozen pizza, so maybe that's what this should be reserved for.  But if you like making your own dough, sauce, toppings, etc.... This isn't the oven for you.<br /><br />Joe.",0

You can smell the motor burning up but nothing is mixing inside the blender.  We've tried putting the ingredients in in different orders, but the results are always the same.  Nothing will happen until you use the big plastic stick they give you to push things around.  That's just irritating.

379,"We bought this blender to replace an Oster blender that seemed to be deteriorating.  We have two main uses: Smoothies and to make pesto sauce.  We have used different blenders for years for these purposes.  The smoothies were fine.  A couple of times this brand new blender would leave a couple of small pea sized chunks of ice but most of the time it was fine.  Then my wife was making the pesto recipe that she has used for years.  This requires fresh basil, parsley, pine nuts, garlic, and 1/2 cup of olive oil.  With all these put into the blender we turned it on and the basil didn't even move.  The lowest portion had some motion but essentially the second main use of the blender was totally worthless.  I called Hamilton Beach and was told that all their blenders require three cups of liquid.  When you look at the illustration on the front of their instruction manual it shows blender full of fruits, vegetables, and ice....but no liquid.  I asked if they had a different interchangeable blade design that would fit.  Nope. They said any returns (if possible) would be done at store.  Our recycling pickup just hauled off the box.  In conclusion every blender we have had over the years would perform this function but our new one wouldn't even begin to puree the recipe (blender even has a puree setting).

386,"Hello<br /><br />This is really a rating of Amazon's website's measurement flubs....not the oven itself<br /><br />We just received this item which Amazon's website says will cook a 12\\"" pizza. That was a factor in our getting the oven and because of that we ordered a 12 inch pizza stone with it.  When the items arrived we tried to fit the stone in the oven.  NO GO.  The stone was WAY too big for the oven.  So, I removed the stone and got out my trusty analog wooden ruler, which I deftly inserted into the front opening of the machine and moved it back as far as it would go which was...10 inches.  The shelf is BARELY 10 inches deep front to back!!!  From side to side the shelf is BARELY 12 1/4\\"" wide.  So dear reader, DO NOT TAKE the measurements offered on Amazon's website at face value.<br /><br />If you want to do 12 inch pizza's in this oven you will have to use a stone/pan that is rectangular and no more than 10\\"" x12\\""<br /><br />While I do not know the reasons for mess up by Amazon, I am going guess that *possibly* something has been lost in translation between metric measures (Breville is a Quebec company and Canada is on the Metric system)and the old-fashioned English measures used in the US.  Just a guess.<br /><br />If you're intent on baking 12 inch ROUND pizza's you will have to get the largest Breville oven to do it.

We have it sitting on an island cart and the cord is so short that the toast can barely reach the edge of the cart while plugged into a standard height wall plug. Second, the lever rubs against the side of the toaster so the bread doesn't actually pop up when finished and then when you pull the lever to the top to get the toast out, the spring isn't strong enough to hold the bread up so you can't let go while you try to remove the bread.

The steam is mentioned for those who use this under wood finished cabinets, excessive steam can damage the finish on some wood cabinets. This is one of the better brewers I have used in that respect.<br /><br />I like the carafe. You can pour a little or a lot at a time and not worry about dribbling coffee all over the place. It took about 12.5 minutes to brew a full 12 cups. This unit has a built in hot plate to keep the coffee at serving temperature. It will automatically shut off after 2 hours but can be programmed for 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours of time. To fill the water reservoir, you lift the top lid and pour the water in at the back. This seems a little awkward at first but I did not spill any water. There is a water level gauge on the front which is handy. At the end of the brew cycle, the coffee temperature was 186 degrees F and after 30 minutes, it was 180 degrees. At one hour the temperature was 182 degrees. I mention that because some reviews, at other sites, complained of coffee that was not hot enough. 180F is HOT.<br /><br />It has a removable charcoal type water filter. I use reverse osmosis water mixed with a little tap water, for flavor, and find a filter unnecessary. It is a nice added feature though. There is also a setting for making 'strong' coffee. I am not sure what that does other than maybe slow down the brew time a little. I use the default 'regular' setting and just adjust the amount of coffee to regulate strength. The end of cycle signal is a nice tone loud enough to get your attention.<br /><br />I grind my own coffee beans and have found that about 1.6 ounces (weight) of fine ground beans will make a darned good pot of brewed coffee in this thing (with a paper filter). The cone type filters (this unit) tend to be a little more efficient than the basket type. As far as which type is 'best' I cannot say. I have gotten excellent coffee from both, you just need to adjust the amount and grind of coffee a little.<br /><br />I did measure the amount of liquid this holds, it is about 72 ounces.<br /><br />I would say this is a good valued coffee maker. It has some nice features and makes coffee just as tasty as my old $100 coffee maker. :)icient than the basket type. As far as which type is 'best' I cannot say.

429,"I bought my Sharp R-409YK at BestBuy for the price this microwave does not deserve anything above three stars. I bought this a little over a year plus I bought an accidental protection warranty which expired on 3/02/2015. Last week on 6/1/2015 my microwave would arc off and on. It didn't happen on everything, It happened on every glass plate I would use (this never happened before). So I started only using plastic, then it would still happen depending on the food, if it was a hot dog it would arc, so I did not heat up hot dogs anymore. The only food that I could heat up was soup or tea without an arc. Then today nothing works no matter what food I put it arcs. hopefully the magnetron is still good. I ordered a sheet of Mica plate to replace the original sheet cover in this microwave hopefully this fixes the arcing issue. Since the microwave oven repairing mica plate is less than $5.00 here on amazon I will give it a shot before dishing this microwave. What happen to the days when microwaves lasted 5 or more years???",0

We were headed on a trip so we needed this mug by a certain date, and the company was of no help and now I have a mug I can't use, and paying for shipping to return a cheap mug is not worth the work.

486,"SUMMARY: Quirks in design limit the functionality of this extremely good-looking kettle.  PROS: = Stylish good looks. (Seriously: this is one sleek kettle!) = A reasonably substantial piece that feels fairly hefty in hand.  CONS: = Small central opening makes cleaning an awkward chore -- which might be an especially significant factor for folks who'll need to clean &/or descale the pot frequently due to hard or soft water issues. = This 1.5 quart kettle brings 6 cups of water to a whistling boil in twice the time it takes a 1.5 quart stainless steel saucepan to bring the same volume of water to a rolling boil, possibly due to the type and/or thickness of the kettle's metal base/walls and its enamel coating. = The kettle's whistle is quite faint.  REVIEW: Count me as a +1 to the critical review that Vine reviewer Bryan Cass (aka &#34;Bee Ry Boogy&#34;) posted for another color of this kettle on May 29, 2014. I wanted to love the black kettle -- which is glossy, gorgeous, and possessed of a slightly smaller capacity than the other colors available (i.e. 1.5 quarts vs. 2 quarts). Alas, I found that the impracticalities of the kettle's design hindered its functioning enough to make using the kettle frustrating.  &#34;Bee Ry Boogy&#34; pointed out that the kettle's central opening is so small that cleaning is difficult. I, too, noticed this upon unpacking and filling the kettle for the first time today. Buyers who live in areas with either very hard water (limescale!) or very soft water (slick build-up!) that will necessitate frequent cleaning of the kettle's insides might be more concerned about this than buyers from other areas. Since my own area has both mega-hard water and an ongoing manganese problem, my first thought when I noted the kettle's tiny opening was, &#34;Uh-oh. Cleaning this is not going to be fun.&#34;  Small central opening issues aside, the real deal-breaker for me was yet another issue that &#34;Bee Ry Boogy&#34; also noted in his review -- namely, the fact that both the thickness and the composition of the kettle's metal walls and their enamel coating make for a kettle that reaches a whistling boil very, very, ***very*** slowly. This might sound like a petty or churlish point made by someone who needs to chill out and let an unwatched pot boil, but please trust me: the kettle really is freakishly slow, as I found when I filled the kettle with lukewarm tap water and placed it on a small burner of my Kenmore electric stove at medium (i.e. #5) this morning. I'm no speed demon, but 38+ minutes (I stopped counting at 38) to reach a whistling boil seemed excessive to me, especially since a covered 1.5 quart stainless steel saucepan can bring water to a raging boil on the very same stove burner at the very same temperature setting in 15-20 minutes. I'm working from home today, so the preternaturally slow boiling time wasn't a big deal for me this morning, but I can imagine finding the kettleâ€™s slow boiling time seriously vexing on mornings when I'm rushing to get to the office.  The clincher for me? When the kettle finally did boil, its whistle was very, very faint.  I'm glad that this kettle has worked for so many; I'd really hoped to count myself among them. Perhaps my kettle was part of an under-achieving batch or something, but for me, the kettle's great looks -- which are impossible to overstate; the danged thing is gorgeous -- are offset by its limited functionality.",0

508,"Despite some of the review I read a year ago prior to purchasing this machine, it was the best, cost effective, dual coffee and espresso maker I could find. I got it home, I use it every day practically and I had no issues with it. I will say the only odd thing I noticed was the coffee will separate in the water. I only noticed this when the pot was getting low and you could actually see the coffee separating. I like strong coffee and I liked the fact that it came with the gold reusable filter so no paper filters required. About after 6 months the coffee did not taste the same. Using a paper filter instead of the gold filter did not help. After 10 months of use I've experienced the water leaking issue on my counter. At first I thought it was a pour issue when adding water to the container, however now, somewhere, water leaks out onto my counter. Now the straw that broke the camel's back, I enjoy a latte on the weekends. My frother is now not working one year later. Oh other MAJOR deficit with the espresso maker, you can only make 1 double or 2 single (same pot) every 10 minutes!!! There is a safety locking mechanism on the espresso side to prevent scalding, so if you are entertaining, it will take you a considerable amount of time to prepare espresso or cappichino's. I am now on a search for my next machine.",0

535,"I bought this mug because of all the positive reviews here at Amazon. I saw that some people had mentioned that the smell of the lid bothered them. I figured that they were just being too sensitive and it wouldn't be a problem for me. I was wrong; the odor from the rubber lid is really offensive. I tried placing the lid in boiling water for 5 minutes, but it didn't help. If the manufacturer came out with a new lid that didn't smell, I'd be first in line to purchase one.<br /><br />I'd also like to mention that I was surprised that it didn't keep my coffee hot for very long. I certainly expected it to, for two reasons; glass is a good insulator and the mug is double walled. I think the heat escapes mainly from the thin rubber lid which isn't insulated at all. Again, a redesigned lid would be a great addition to the aesthetically appealing mug.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that if I had it to do over again and I knew what I know now, I'd look elsewhere.",0

553,"I wrote the Swiss Diamond company and asked for an explanation of what the nano-composite material was made of.<br /><br />After a week or so, I received a polite reply from Allan Wolk, an employee in the U.S. His email informed me that, \\""Our patented nonstick surface uses a nano-composite of real diamond crystals and PTFE; it is applied using a computer controlled plasma gun at very high temperatures.\\""<br /><br />Naturally, my attention was immediately drawn to the PTFE. The acronym sounded familiar. What was PTFE?<br /><br />A quick search of Wikipedia provided the answer: [...]<br /><br />As Wikipedia explains:<br /><br />Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a fluoropolymer discovered by Roy J. Plunkett (1910-1994) of DuPont in 1938. It was introduced as a commercial product in 1946 and is generally known to the public by DuPont's brand name TeflonÂ®.<br /><br />Huh? Teflon? Wait a minute. Didn't the Swiss Diamond website just claim that the product contained no Teflon?<br /><br />If you look back at the Swiss Diamond website screen capture, the careful wording of their answer now becomes clear. It states, \\""The Swiss Diamond coating does not contain any Teflon taking into consideration that \\""Teflon\\"" is a trade mark, made and owned by DUPONT.\\""<br /><br />So the pans don't contain Teflon, they just contain the chemical called Teflon. It's like saying a nuclear warhead doesn't contain any plutonium, it only contains nuclear fissionable material.<br /><br />For the manufacturer to insist the Swiss Diamond pans contain no Teflon whatsoever when it is made primarily from polytetrafluoroethylene, the chemical widely known as Teflon, is extremely deceptive. In fact, the intent of the Swiss Diamond company seems to be to deceive consumers by omission of the facts. The FAQ document on the Swiss Diamond website, for example, does not bother to say something like, \\""But our pans do contain PTFE, the chemical known as Teflon.\\"" It simply insists they contain no Teflon and moves on to the next question.<br /><br />It seems that Swiss Diamond goes out of its way to give the impression that this product is free of Teflon chemicals and is surfaced primarily with diamonds. That's the impression I got, anyway, and I read the promotional materials several times before purchasing the pan.<br /><br />Consumers have been hoodwinked yet again, in the name of corporate interests ,and BIG money, for the filthy rich executives who produce obscenely overpriced products and sell them to trusting consumers.y to give the impression that this product is free of Teflon chemicals and is surfaced primarily with diamonds.

555,"I spent hours researching programmable kettles, and even ordered a different one before getting this one - the gooseneck Bonavita. It was smaller than this one and cost more than twice as much! When it came I decided it wasn't big enough, so I returned it and was very happy to find this one. THIS IS THE BEST!  It is just as big as other electric kettles, 1.7 liters, and barely costs more than a regular non-programmable kettle, but has soooo many more features. I love being able to see the temperature climb as it heats up - or drop as it cools down - so that I can use whatever temperature of water I need. And, of course, I often set it to the green tea setting so that it just heats up to that level and no more. One reviewer said the controls were &#34;non-intuitive&#34; and difficult - but I don't understand that comment at all. To me they seem very, very easy and also intuitive. (That one review comment almost scared me off of this kettle, and I'm so glad it didn't.) I LOVE THIS KETTLE!

First of all, I have not had one problem with the carafe overflowing during brewing.  I give it a little shake every time I put it in to convince myself that that little ball is not stuck in there.  I clean it occasionally but not religiously.  I position it correctly in the coffemaker.  No problems, ever, and I use it at least once a day for that year.  I find it does a good job keeping the coffee hot.  I think expecting more than this carafe gives you is expecting too much.  The price you pay for piping hot coffee is a slow pour, and I do explain that to visitors so they don't end up tipping it upside down and making a mess.  It takes a couple more seconds than you expect to pour a mug, but that only makes sense in a well-sealed carafe.  The programming function works fine, the coffee tastes great.

560,"I bought this toaster because I though buying an expensive toaster would actually produce good toast! What a joke! The first toaster I bought was a Black & Decker model for about $40. It was so terrible at making toast I returned it instantly and got this KitchenAid model.<br /><br />First of all, the design is nice. It's solid and looks good. It 'works' nicely. However it does NOT toast toast evenly. It ALWAYS toasts one side more than the other no matter what slot you put it into. The different setting do make a noticeable change in toasting, but still, the uneven cooking is present. The other annoying thing about this toaster is it beeps 3 times when the toast pops up. Why 3 times? It's so loud and high pitched it actually hurts your ears! You can't disable it, or even muffle it. I returned the thing and got another to make sure I didn't get a lemon. Same thing exactly. So I returned that one too.<br /><br />Hey KitchenAid and all other toaster makers. If you can't make a toaster that ACTUALLY toasts CORRECTLY, then maybe you shouldn't be making toasters! OR, is it you fail to have any quality control on these items that are being pumped out of China? Toast doesn't take rocket science to make. a $15 toaster should make great toast. A $70 toaster should make PERFECT toast! I'm tired of buying junk products that these companies put out. My old GE toaster that was 30 years old and I think it only cost about $20, but it made PERFECT toast and it looked nice. Simple but nice.

564,". . . the flavor and temperature of the brew ae excellent. The carafe keeps it hot long enough for me to drink what I've made. It has never given me the 5-beep announcement that \\""Coffee's ready!\\"" but I'm hanging around waiting for the red light to go off anyway, so it doesn't really matter. I am particularly pleased with the uniform grind this machine achieves. The resulting flavor is rich and not bitter. I like strong coffee. I drink coffee because I like its taste. No sugar, no cream, no powdered non-dairy product with artificial flavors to cover up - overpower - the taste of the bean, but it's alright with me if others do. Yes, there are a lot of parts and pieces to wash, wipe and find a place for when reassembling the thing, but hey, that's just part of the ritual that gives the coffee drinker pleasure. But, if you need more than two pots a day, the ritual will lose its appeal. I have not tested the programing feature yet, so can hardly comment on it. It might disappoint me if, as others have reported, the unheated carafe spoils the temperature of the coffee made automatically at 6:00 a.m. but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. It's early in my experience curve, so I reserve the write to update this review with the benefit of more experience.

I'm really disappointed at the quality.<br /><br />There are certainly things to improve in design. For example, instead of just gluing the metal layer to the foam layer on lid, it will be better if the layers are wrapped by the outer plastic layer.",0
574,"The Keurig is sadly, not well designed. The water lines that transport the water from the reservoir are very thin. Mineral deposits from the water build up easily, clogging the lines. Once that happens, you will not get your cup of coffee. You will get aggravated and frustrated. A few weeks ago I was home from work for the day and decided to tackle the kerurig and hopefully get it working again. I went on - line to \\""troubleshoot\\"". Seems like this is the biggest (and chronic) problem with these machines. I followed the directions and used 2 gallons of vinegar to \\""descale\\"". This means you keep pumping vinegar into the machine, and also letting steam loosen up any calcium deposits.  This process takes a fair amount of time. That solved the problem for a couple of weeks - then I had the problem again. I do not have the time to keep descaling the machine, nor do I wish to invest in gallons of vinegar. I'm looking for a different brand now. I can't reward Keurig with new dollars to replace this coffee maker that I've only had 2 years.",0
575,"Received this yesterday and I've already made 2 batches of Arepas.  So quick an easy.  They cook in about 10-15 minutes.  I didn't want an Arepa maker since they seem to make them thicker, this takes about 1/4 cup dough.  They are a nice size, about a large cookie.  I love that one side is flat and the other domed.  I stuffed cheese in the last batch to melt in the middle, delicious.  This is the arepa flour I use: [[ASIN:B005IGI08U Harina PAN 6 PACK White Corn Meal Flour 6 x 1 Kg Venezuela]]<br /><br />Going to try little round gluten-free goodies in this: brownies, cookies, cake. Biscuits and filled bread dough may work in this, also. I'll fill the gluten-free cookies with ice cream for ice cream sandwiches.<br /><br />The red color is a non-stick surface (I didn't know it was non-stick before purchase).  I haven't oiled it at all and the Arepas don't stick. It cooks at one temperature.  Plug it in and it turns on, unplug and it turns it off...all of these type of gadgets seem to work the same way.<br /><br />If this keep working, it's a good little investment on just the Areaps.  No standing over a hot stove during this heatwave.<br /><br />***Over a year later and it still works.  I can't use it as much since I need to watch my carbs due to health so it isn't getting used as much, now.  I still do make my gluten-free items with this, on occasion - mini brownies and cakes turn out beautifully.  Muffin mix makes portioned sized 'cookie' shapes, flat on one side, domed on the other.

The first time I asked for a power unit replacement that I was willing to pay, but they said don't provide separately.<br />The second time I claimed a replacement for the unit if the warranty was still valid. The slow answering customer support just sought an easy way out to void the warranty. At the same time, I also hired two technicians but they were unable to fix it.<br /><br />The grinder looks good and it's easy to operate. However, there's a high probability that it won't work with oily or sticky beans.

In order to push a large piece of food (a potato, say) into the bowl through whatever blade you are using, you must first unclick the inner sleeve, put the potato in, push the sleeve back on and lock it into place, then push the potato with the pusher (which must be purchased separately).  This is way too much work.  Our old lid was fine, but wouldn't work with the new bowl until I cut off a tiny piece of plastic from the new bowl where the lid locks into place.

Unfortunately, the way this press is constructed, there is a strange ridge just inside the lip that easily deforms the screen filter when you remove the press piston for cleaning. Once deformed, it remains creased permanently (the beauty of steel) and allows plenty of grounds up past the filter into the drinkable portion of the coffee. My press actually came with its first filter pre-deformed, but a quick note to the company and I received another pristine one (and a reprimand stating that all future filters would be subject to purchase, rather than warranty). That second filter also deformed within the first week of use, and I've been chewing my coffee ever since.<br /><br />On the plus side, coffee made in this press stays warm for a good long time, eliminating the need for a separate insulated decanter.

636,"This toaster oven is the result of careful engineering to make it absolutely the cheapest possible toaster oven ever built. It is ridiculously flimsy. The power cord is 24\\"" (2 feet long). I measured it. Unless you are positioning the oven literally right in front of an outlet you will need an extension cord. Seriously, that is how cheap this thing is: they saved money by making the power cord too short.    Also, the power cord is UNGROUNDED so the oven is actually dangerous. With no grounding it means the metal case of the oven could potentially be a shock hazard. I strongly advise against buying ungrounded appliances. If a short develops inside the unit, you could electrocute yourself by touching the outside of the oven.    I am using the oven a little but in all honesty I expect to break soon it is so cheap.

I bought these Caphalons for the way they felt and plus they have a nice look in the kitchen (each knife is also labeled at the base, which is handy).  I like heavier knives and these are indeed that.  The blades are thick and very sturdy.  They do need to be sharpened somewhat regularly though, perhaps every tenth use, but that is the nature of knives (if it seems that you are using too much force to be cutting food, then the blade probably needs sharpening).  I have no doubt these will last many more years.  I also never put them in the dishwasher and have had no issues with rusting.

667,I have had this blender for two years. This blender is a Professional grade blender. It is very heavy and high quality.

673,"I bought two of these for my girlfriend after she had broken a couple of the glass carafes.  It seemed to be the perfect solution since the price was the same as a glass replacement.  To my disappointment, the handles became loose after a few days, and one of the handles fell off within a week.  There is no set screw.  The plastic handle just jams onto a welded projection on the side.  I couldn't get it to seat firmly, so I had to super-glue it back on.  I removed the handle on the second carafe and glued it back on also, rather than have a loose handle that might come off when the carafe is full of hot coffee.  Who knows how long the repairs will last.  We do not have a dishwasher and we have not dropped or mis-handled the items.  It's a pity because the solid stainless-steel body should last a lifetime, and should be safer than a glass carafe.

676,"I just bought one of these Bissell Spot Lifters--actually, I bought this cordless one and then returned it for a corded one because the idea of it running for only 15 minutes on a twelve hour charge suggested to me that I would be forever charging it before finishing the job that I bought it for.  But maybe that's the problem.  I didn't buy it so much to pick up spills as I did to clean my staircase.  I have a Hoover Steam Vac which is an incredible machine--gets out just about everything.  But it is cumbersome to use on the stairs, so I thought it would be great to get a little handheld machine. <br /> <br />So, I got my corded Bissell Spot Lifter, filled up the tank, and got to work on my very dirty staircase (made dirty by my 85 pound Labrador Retriever!)  The next day, after everything had dried, I surveyed the results.  Not bad...the steps definately looked cleaner.  But the ground in stains were still there.  The Hoover would have gotten them out with little effort. (And, by the way, it took a lot longer than 15 minutes!) <br /> <br />Next, I tried the Bissell Spot Lifter on a small carpet stain in my family room that had been sitting for a couple days (That same 85 pound Lab got into the trash and had a buffet on the carpet).  Since I knew the Hoover steam vac would get it out, I was in no rush to get to it before the stain set.  Plus, I didn't feel like lugging out that big machine, which is another reason why I bought the Spot Lifter. The Spot Lifter didn't do a thing for that stain.  Later that day, my son spilled Juicy Juice on the sofa--not a lot, just what leaked out of a sippy cup lid.  Again, the Spot Lifter made little impact, even on this fresh spill. <br /> <br />So, bottom line for me, the Spot Lifter will clean my staircase as long as it has no tough stains.   But for serious spills and stains, I'm getting out the old Hoover. <br /> <br />As for ease of use, it's not that great.  You have to constantly pump the trigger on thie Spot Lifter to getthe solution out.  One pump gives one squirt.  So you pump, pump, pump until the stain is covered.  Then you scrub (and the corded version does have nice rotating brushes for this--absent on the cordless), and then you tilt the machine upward to suction off the liquid.  Again, comparing to the Hoover--the Hoover has a trigger that you push in and hold down for as long as you need the solution to come out, so it's much easier on the fingers.  And the Hoover's suction is SO much better.  It picks up SO much more liquid than the Spot Lifter. <br /> <br />Of course, for $40 versus $300 or so, perhaps it's not fair to compare the two.  But I was hoping that the Spot Lifter would at least come close to the performance of the Hoover, just with a much smaller cleaning path.  Since I couldn't get that, couldn't it be as easy to use?  No.",0

723,"So, like most of you who bought this product, I am also a coffee lover. I have been thinking about buying a french press since a while but was not sure about how much difference exists between coffee made with a french press and a brewing machine. finally I just went ahead with the purchase reading so many positive reviews about the product. Here's what I think about the product :  The strainer/filter does not work well. It worked decently the first couple of times and then i have never had a press without grounds in the coffee.. in all I must have used the press say about 7-8 times in total... I usually dont bother about writing reviews (i am working on changing that). But today when i used the press i felt that nearly half the grounds got un filtered..  Yes i know exactly how to use the press for people who might be thinking I am doing something incorrectly and hence I am seeing grounds in the coffee..  i literary take good 5-10 seconds to push the filter down to the bottom for a half filled jar (which equals around 16 oz = 1 cup for me)and i still cannot manage to filter out all the grounds...  the cleaning process is tricky as well as you wouldn't wanna touch the filter too much as there is a possibility of bending the edges of the aluminium filter which will render the filter useless.  I will definitely not recommend this product unless you are willing to pay $10 for a replacement filter every now and then and or would not mind using a separate strainer on the side.",0

736,"Foodsaver v3230 and Jar Sealers<br />The main reason I purchased a Foodsaver vacuum sealer was to be able to store my cats' (my Boys') dry food to help maintain freshness, since I spend extra money to buy a high quality food that loses its freshness and spoils quickly when not stored properly - and yes, it is dry food.  Plus, I wanted to be able to store this food in glass containers.  I found the Ball 1/2 gallon canning jars and am able to store the contents of an 18 pound bag of food in 8 of these jars using the Foodsaver wide-mouth jar sealer.  It's great!  I wish I had known about all these contraptions before now - would have saved a lot of wasted food/money.  I also store human food but started out buying it for my Boys' food.<br />I am so thankful for the reviews; many of the comments were very helpful!  One person wrote that she thought she would have to use one jar sealer for each jar she used.  That's exactly what I thought.  That would have been quite expensive and didn't seem worth it to me - given that the wide mouth jar sealers are approx $10 and for some reason the regular mouth jar sealers I've found have been more than that.  so, one jar sealer can be used over & over & over again along with the flat part of the lid of the canning jar.  After vacuuming the air out and removing the jar sealer, I put on the screw-on band.  Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself.<br />When I 1st started using this machine, I was using it wrong and every time I tried to seal a 1/2 gallon jar using the wide mouth jar sealer, the machine would run for 2 minutes - every time.  I just thought the 1/2 gallon required more vacuuming due to the amount of air in that size.  Nope; it would also run two minutes on the smaller jars.  Also, when I would try to take the jar sealer off, I had to be extremely careful so the lid of the canning jar didn't come off with it - which it did in many cases using the wide mouth jar sealer and which it did every time when I used the regular mouthjar sealer.  It was very aggravating.  I was ready to return everything.  On top of that, when I used the bags, no air was being vacuumed out, but it would seal.  I knew something was wrong.  That's when I found the TurboedMX6 YouTube video.<br /><br />If you search the internet for Foodsaver v3230, one of the first links that I found that is listed is a YouTube video by TurboedMX6.  This guy did a very nice job and went a long way to helping me use this machine properly.  I highly recommend it.  He didn't talk about the jar sealers;  he only talked about vacuum-sealing plastic bags, but the video helped me with both.<br />In the video, when he turned the locking handle, it made a definitive sound, and I remembered that mine didn't make that sound, because I didn't turn it all the way; it kinda snaps into place.  It's amazing how everything finally worked after that.  Air gets sucked out of the plastic bags now, and the jar sealer is absolutely fantastic.  It vacuums the jars for 10-15 seconds.  When it's done making a lot of noise vacuuming, the \\""seal\\"" light comes on, so I press cancel, because I'm not using the heat portion of the sealing process which is used to seal the plastic bags.<br />I take the hose connection out of the jar sealer, and it makes a brief whoosh sound releasing any leftover air from the hose (something I also learned in another review).  I never got any whooshing sounds before when the machine would run for 2 minutes.  Now I can take the jar sealer off the jar without being hesitant or extra careful.  that lid is on there so tight, it's sometimes difficult to break the seal to open it again.  That's okay.  I'd rather have that than to have to be extra gentle with it so I didn't break the seal.<br />I have bought several cases of many different sizes of the canning jars, and I have purchased extra food for my Boys to keep on hand.  I also store food to take to work.  I'm so happy with this investment of all these foodsaving products!",1

I was disappointed as we bought this to replace my 15 yr old Krups machine that we had already given away. First off it just flat out didn't work with the 1 shot basket. After about a month or so it just stopped working- it would get nice and hot, steam milk etc but no espresso would come out, and when it did it was spotty or shot out over extracted. We are highly disappointed that we wasted nearly $200 on this hunk of junk.",0
749,"I have used Farberware percolators for years, and my existing one was dying.  Amazon said it would be fulfilled by someone called Tradecozone.  The product was actually received from Overstock.com.  I would never have paid full price for something from Overstock.com.  It came in an anonymous brown box (no original packaging), was an older model (short center post, which Farberware has changed on the new ones), and had been used (there were coffee stains at the six-cup level).<br /><br />I don't blame this on Farberware, which makes a great product that I am loyal to.  I blame it on Amazon, who apparently does not adequately police their vendors.  They should be ashamed.",0

754,"I bought two sets of these rings (4 rings total) after seeing them ages ago in a down comforter manufacturer's catalogue.  We have two king-sized feather pillows that have always taken FOREVER to dry in our dryer.  These rings make the difference in the time it takes to dry them and the loft of fluffiness.  It still takes time to dry them, but it's a lot less.  It used to take four to five hours of repeated high-temp dryer cycles to get them completely dry.  Now it takes two to three hours maximum, and they're lofted to the max.  I thought about getting a pair of cheap sneakers to use instead but realized they'd probably cost about as much as two sets of rings and last half as long, so I just bought the rings (plus I figure they save me a buck or two on running the dryer).  I also use them on throw pillows, our down comforter, or anything else that's poofy and needs the benefit of pummelling in the dryer.  I like them--they work.  Only downside:  they're noisy.  If you need to do something requiring close listening while the dryer's running, and you can't get away from the laundry area or close a door between you and the dryer, then save it for when the sound isn't an issue.",1

I can't comment on whether or not you could wear them handling very hot foods for a prolonged period of time, but they definitely worked for what I did with them.  When you want to clean them just keep them on and wash with dish soap and water.  I also ran them through the dishwasher cycle on the upper rack to remove a faint lingering odor (of ham). If you have small hands get the petite mitt.  This size worked great for me.  You may not use these often but if and when you need them you won't regret your purchase.",1

I found I could buy a replacement insert at crockpot.com. for $15. I almost bought it, however, the shipping charges were about $8. For $26 it would be delivered to my door in about 6 business days.

778,"I have to give this thing 1 star. I have seen, over the 2 years I've had it, many of the problems in other reviews. I too had constantly bought low-end Mr. Coffee machines (anything with auto-brew) and rarely had problems that were unexpected. I mean, for a $30 coffee maker, you expect to replace it every few years, right?  Well, I had some extra money when my Mr Coffee started causing grief (temp sensor on the hotplate died after about 6 years) and I figured it was time for a good machine with a larger brew capacity. I got the Kitchenaid for about $78 (normally $120)on sale, employee discount, etc... Although it HAS lasted about 2 years, the coffee not going in the carafe was a real pain. I tried everything, right down to pulling off the spring-loaded arm for serving while brewing (which actually seemed to work). Sometimes it spilled, sometimes not. Finally found the solution a few months ago and have not had a problem since - raise the back of the unit about 1/2 to 1\\"". I just put a folded kitchen towel under it.  Yeah, it'a a pain to clean... and the beeping CAN get annoying, but it was finally working right.  This morning the display got \\""err2\\"". Now, nothing... Fortunately, I saved my old Mr. Coffee with the bypassed temp sensor (it had 2 and 1 was bad) so I can still have coffee.  Save your money - don't buy these things unless they are priced in line with the Black and Decker, Mr. Coffee or any on-sale Wal-Mart machine.  I expected lots more from a $120 machine. We are not impressed.",0

The metal screw on the lid also rusted.<br />I figured it would be fine if I just used it to steam things then, and the second time I steamed something the entire bottom of the pan rusted, and my food and bamboo steamer came out smelling very funny.<br />If you are very careful with it, or don't cook much at all, it might be worth it, but otherwise I would invest in something a little less flimsy.",0

Hotel room had a small refridgerator so we brought can of Pam, sliced canadian bacon, eggs, english muffins and butter. Other team mates had to leave the hotel ($40 breakfast buffet!!!) to go to fo offsite to IHOP and McDonalds while still others had to wait in very long line for their breakfast (muffin, donuts, & coffee) at the limited selection vendor in tournament lobby.<br />I haven't had the cleaning issues but I will say I wipe out the water tray and soap wash the trays, top, and egg cups after each use.<br />The toaster seems to run on the light side but works well for the mcmuffin combo.

819,"For the price, these pans get 4 stars.  Of course they are not your heavy bottomed $500+ pan set and I did not expect them to be.  These are the pans you give to children as they head off to college because their roommate does not know that you don't use metal utensils with non-stick coating or you don't cut cookie bars on the pan.  These are the pans you bring camping because if someone breaks into your tent, you won't be in tears when you come back from your hike.<br />Things to know:<br />1. The pans are thin so things boil/cook faster which means they also can burn much faster.  You have to play with the temperature a bit if you are used to thicker pans.... and stir much more to prevent uneven cooking.<br />2. The pans are a really dark/deep red and not the bright and cheery red that many people are looking for when purchasing red utensils for their kitchen.<br />3. So far it has held up well in my dishwasher.  No Teflon peeling thus far.  Honestly, I am not a fan of Teflon due to all the scary research being done.  With that said, I like to have a few cheap Teflon pans in my arsenal (for those meals where it takes an hour to pick and peel the mess out of a non-Teflon pan).  Also, don't feel like I loose a ton of money when I throw them out once the Teflon starts to go.<br />4.  The nylon utensils are &#34;meh.&#34;  I prefer silicone utensils that don't melt if they end up falling at the bottom of the dishwasher or are accidentally left in the pot a little too long.  The utensils are not very flexible and I see these as &#34;temporary&#34; and can be used in a pinch or again, in a camping situation.<br /><br />Overall, a decent set for the price point and one that would make a great gift for a camper, a young college student or a family who doesn't yet have the resources to purchase a high-end set.",1

828,"I had the smaller 14 oz Nissan stainless Thermos mug, but it didn't have the liquid capacity to get the job done with drip coffee.  I needed more liquid sunshine to get me going on the drive to work.  So, I gave this one a shot.<br />First of all, these Nissan Thermos mugs are incredibly good at keeping coffee HOT, and for a long period of time.  If you're not careful, you can easily burn your tongue 2 hours after you poured your coffee.  IMO,that's a good thing.<br />Second of all, I really like how the top of the mug is engineered to prevent accidental spilling down the front of your shirt.  You can easily close and open the top of the mug with your thumb, to prevent splashing while this monster is planted firmly on your dashboard.  By the way, I've never had a problem with it remaining firmly planted on the dashboard.<br />Third, I really like the rubber grip on the body.  Not everyone likes to use the mug handle, including me, and it's nice to have a non slip grip to grab on to.  We're not always our most coordinated in the morning.<br />And, lastly, it's incredibly cool looking.  I get frequent compliments on my monster mug.<br />I don't think you can go wrong here.",1

But the heating elements on these units always fizz out. You might get 3 years tops out of another model (I've tried 3 different manufacturers).

I finally bought a Nutri Ninja Pro, and I like it MUCH better - it was cheaper (priced at $93 to $99) and clean up is much easier - no gaskets to deal with, a wide base makes it easier to reach inside the opening and clean.  So far so good with the Ninja.  I won't be going back to the Bullet, the Ninja is my new best friend.",0
836,These knives are junk!  I have had 2 break off at the handle. One broke while I was cutting an apple. The blade broke off and flew up in my face. They can not cut good at all. They are very expensive for the junk they are. Don't waste your money.,0

839,"Very flimsy, feels like it'll break whenever you flip the waffles.  Doesn't cook evenly.  Even with adjustable heat settings, I either got a doughy mess after cooking for 15 minutes, or a nice crisp outside with a doughy center.  I could never get it to cook a waffle properly.  The recipes in the book also are missing something.  I followed them to the letter, and I got a batter that was so thick I would have been better off letting it sit and rise and making a thick hearty loaf of bread out of it.",0
840,I've had my little Oskar for nearly 30 years.  It was a gift from my mother and I absolutely love it.  it's small but sturdy and it does a great job when it comes to puree.

The pans always look really dirty when I'm done cooking, but some hot water and a quick swipe with a scrubber sponge and they are clean.<br /><br />The one caveat that has been mentioned here, and I agree with, is to use a lower heat setting than you would use with non-stick cookware.  I'm down to about 2/3 of what I used to set the burner on for my old non-stick.<br /><br />So, low heat and pay attention to your food and these pans are the best!",1

850,"I purchased this coffee maker to replace a failed B&D Space Saver (sound like a common scenario). I can only reiterate what's been said before. When it worked, it bellowed enough steam to kill my kitchen cabinets. I did find it a bit irritating that it was all but impossible to remove the last bit of coffee. My biggest complaint overall is that it finally died around month five. Caput. Since I had to remove it and place it on the counter surface months ago due to cabinet damage, I concluded that I really didn't need an under the counter maker. I did the research and ended up with a Cuisinart BD1200. VASTLY SUPERIOR! Better flavor, easier to clean - and no steam! I definitely won't be looking back.",0

860,"I think that they must be paying people to write good reviews about this product! So sorry I believed the reviews.  It is too small and terribly designed; my old OXO grater was much better, but I ordered this one because the OXO broke.  I waited too long to try and return it, so now I'm stuck with it.  You can only put a VERY SMALL piece of parmesan in the grater.  Maybe enough for two people's pasta or risotto.  NOt v convenient when serving any more than two.  You have to hold it up to grate the cheese, can't just grate over a plate and stop when you have enough. It doesn't stay shut, so you can't store it in fridge with cheese. (I guess why would you when the space for cheese is tiny, but that was what I did with my old one.)  And even when you put it on a plate to rest on table, the tiny piece of cheese falls out.  I rarely write reviews, but am spending the time in hopes it will save another person from buying this item!",0

864,"A little over two and one half years ago, I ordered my first KRUPS 1010 Conical Coffee maker from the KRUPS Online Store. It worked fine until one day it stopped working. I called the KRUPS people and they told me they can fix it if I send it in. The cost of the repair and shipping was going to be almost the same as if I had bought a new one. In fact the difference was less than $10.00.<br /><br />We decided to bite the bullet and order a new second one. Yesterday, after a year and three months, our second KRUPS coffee maker literally burned from the inside out. After unplugging it from the electric outlet, we had to use a fire extinguisher to put out the mini fire. Our house was filled with smoke.<br /><br />We are not heavy coffee drinkers so we donâ€™t over use this maker. Two brand new KRUPS Conical Coffee makers in less than two and one half years, proves to me that this unit is very inferior and not durable.<br /><br />I will never buy this coffee maker again. You better off buying a cheap brand coffee maker, under $20.00, and when it breaks you will not be shedding tears and forking money.",0

It hadn't even occurred to me that something marketed as a lunch container set wouldn't be leak proof. Also, the size of the sandwich box was a little bigger than I would have liked for a child's lunch. The colors and shapes of the containers are fun, but because it leaks it just doesn't work for me.",0

879,In many ways this is a great whisk.  Scrambling eggs in my non-stick saucepan is breeze and clean up is easier than with traditional balloon whisks.  But a design issue that I wouldn't expect from a manufacturer of this quality has me wishing I hadn't bought it. Basically the handle is far too heavy for the rest of the design.  When you first hold it it appears to have a good heft - but all that weight is in the handle while the balls themselves are very light. So you expend more effort than necessary to whip well.  And the darn thing will *not* stay in a bowl unless the sides of the bowl are high enough to lean the handle on - the number of times it has fallen out and dropped onto my kitchen floor has driven me mad.  I now  avoid this whisk in favor of my older whisks whenever I can. It's a real disappointment.,0

She recently told my wife that she is extatic with it and that it makes her job a lot easier.  Best little gift I've bought her that came with so much gratitude.",1

887,"Update #2:  You can read the info below and see my concerns.  You will also note that we replaced the smaller unit with the larger one, even with the quality concerns.  So as a quick update on the larger one, the same seems to be the case - great coffee, but questionable build quality.  We have used the unit now for about 5 months and we do use it daily.  The tabs on the lid have broken as they did on the small one.  So far, that is the only thing, but it is one of those frustrations that can result in coffee everywhere if someone does not know it and fails to keep a finger on the top when pouring!  Perhaps the other issues will not surface, but a quick failure of a simple thing like the lid, twice in two units, does not inspire confidence.  (I need another cup of coffee!)      I regret that my first online review must be negative, but . . .    Pros:      >  Great cup of coffee.  We found that changing the filter every month, even if not broken, keeps the flavor at its best.  No matter how you clean the filter, a new one, for some reason, clearly improves the taste.      >  Quick and relatively easy to use.  Clean up is more work than a traditional machine, but the coffee flavor makes it worth it.    Cons:    >  Unfortunately, the quality does not yield longevity.  We bought ours in April 2004.  Since then:       a) The lid tabs broke so if you forget and simply poor a cup, you have coffee everywhere as the lid pops off.       b) By January 05, there is coffee leaking around the bottom of the pot.  Clearly the plastic body is failing and it looks like we will need to replace this unit soon.      For the record, we have used this almost daily as our primary coffee machine but everything has been cleaned by hand (no dishwasher cleaning which is not recommended).  So we are sure that we have used it as intended, but the construction quality simply was not up to the daily usage in our experience.    Now for the hard part:  Finding a replacement that brews as good a cupas this, but one that will last!    ADDENDUM:  (Or Addendumb?)  Okay, so it is roughly one week later and now the handle to the coffee pot has broken off entirely.  A third problem in less than a year!  I plan to contact Bocdum so we will see what they say, but it wouldn't seem too unreasonable to expect a coffee maker to work once daily for more than 9 months, right?  And to make matters worse, not having found a suitible replacement based upon all my research, we are now awaiting delivery on our new 12 cup Bodum Santos!  God help us!",0
888,"These glasses are certainly big and look like something you might find in a nicer bar but if you expect them to be heavy . . . these may not be for you.  These look like they should be heavy but are not.  My 12 oz beer glasses are heavier (the type that come 4 in a box and found in every bar across America type).  I disagree with the reviews that suggest these are too big to hold comfortably- they do feel substantial in your hand but not so much that I can not hold on to it-  a child may have issues holding it but these weren't meant to be serving juice to kids.<br /><br />Another point to note, they have a minimalist look to them- since they are double rocks glasses they are short and look \\""squaty\\"" maybe even a little out of proportion.  But if you consider these are 13.5 oz glasses that are just as tall as a regular low-ball glass they will require a larger diameter and thus be a little \\""squaty\\"".  The pictures do not do a great job revealing this to the consumer but to those that know what they are looking at this is no surprise.  To a novice like me, it's different,  but I do not know how you would make a 13.5 oz glass look any better while still being true to what a \\""double rocks\\"" glass is suppose to be.<br /><br />Rim and wall are thin- I compared these to my older (and cheaper) rocks glass and the zwiesel glasses are thinner.  However, these are cyrstal and not pressed glass so expectations should be different.  I've put these in the dishwasher without issue.<br /><br />The  4 star rating is specifically due to the shortcomings in the weight - however,  I am happy with the purchase and recommend them to somebody that liked this look- but if they specifically want a heavy glass and were not concerned about the actual amount/size of the glass (not really caring if they were double sized)- then I would not suggest these as a first choice there maybe others out there that fit that bill better.<br /><br />**Extended use Update***<br />I've had those glasses of overa year and lost two to the dishwasher - I suspect due to the thin glass.  While I still like them I have to take off another star due to their frailty.  We have the cheaper cut crystal glasses that you can get at and better department store that come from somewhere in Europe - not overly expensive probably $4 a glass and a lot smaller than these and they have held up for 13 years and counting with hundreds of washings in the dishwasher and by hand.  While they are an old pattern and not as cool as these- they have certainly paid for themselves in terms of cost per use.  I wouldn't buy these Schott Zweisel again and the ones I have left I'll have to hand wash to preserve their life.  I would no longer recommend them and the two stars are because they say they are dishwasher safe (hard to agree with because of the thinner glass).  Common sense really says wash by hand and you'll be ok but when compared to the ones if had at better bars, these fall short in weight and durability and when compared to my old cut style cheaper crystal that have taken a beating for 13+years these also fall short.  Therefore, now it's only 2 stars.",0

902,"My wife and I had enough of making popcorn on our stove, so we decided to purchase a popper.  We looked forward to our Cuisinart because we eat a lot of popcorn, this would be a convenient way to make it, and we have other Cuisianrt products that we enjoy.  This product is troublesome.  As others note, the plastic shield that forms the top of the unit does not fit well, is flimsy, and the butter well often rises from its place when the machine is in operation.  In addition (and more importantly), kernels come out of the shoot and fly all over the place during the popping process, but particularly early in the process.  To add insult to injury, the popped corn flies out, too, because the chute is too short.  Ours ends up all over the counter and often on the floor.  Adding just a couple more inches to the spout and  to the unit itself would have solved these problems.  I do not recommend purchasing this product.  How Cuisinart could have allowed this poor design to slip through suggests a lack of care about quality.  Seems like it was engineered by design school flunkies.  Oh--and one more thing just for laughs.  One of the benefits that the instruction manual lists is the embossed \\""Cuisinart\\"" logo on the unit.  As someone who often discounts negative reviews on Amazon as written by really picky people, I can assure you that that is not a characteristic of this reviewer.  This is truly a bad product.  I'm really disappointed.",0

Also twice (and only after making multiple cups, (one right after the other), the 3rd cup tasted like plastic.  I was really liking this machine for the froth and the customizing option but I cannot get over the taste.  The smell, not so much, after all, it is made out of alot of plastic so I suppose when heated up you are going smell it, especially when new. That might go away.

930,"We purchased a pair of these microwave safe mugs for my mother who struggles with parkinsonism, and she simply loves them.<br /><br />Being that she can only bear so much weight in her hand, this small, lightweight cup gives her the freedom to enjoy her coffee each day without much fear of it slipping, dropping, and/or breaking. So far it has held up to a few, let's say... &#34;unintentional&#34; crash tests, mostly at the hands of our toddler.<br /><br />My mom said that these cups keep the beverage temperature even, and that while small, they're &#34;just her size&#34;. The opening for the handle measures ~2.25&#34; x ~0.75&#34;. For scale, I've included a photo of the mug with a quarter resting on it below.<br /><br />We've washed these mugs both by hand and in the dishwasher, and in both cases they came clean quickly, without any apparent staining. If you're interested, these mugs are available in [[ASIN:B004XXMHY2 red]] and [[ASIN:B004XXMI00 brown]] as well. We've purchased all three, and I'm pleased to report the same high quality all around, no matter which mug you choose.<br /><br />Altogether, we're thrilled with this purchase, as these mugs have given my mom a modicum of her independence back. I highly recommend these for anyone who struggles with dexterity/strength issues, but I also think that they're great for kids, hikers, and able-bodied adults alike!<br /><br />Feel free to leave me a comment or question, Iâ€™m happy to add anything else youâ€™d like to know about the product. Thanks for taking the time to read my review, hopefully this information was useful!",1
931,It is well made and easy to use.,1
932,Carafe is made out of very thin glass. I used it for one week before it cracked and broke.,0
933,Just received this and it says it is new but has all kinds of scratches on it that I doubt that it is new. Disappointed for sure!!,0
934,upon using over time became very difficult to cut. blades would make an uneven cut. I expected better from a cutter that was made of steel.,0
935,I ordered this product because I have other nissan thermos's and they are great and keep hot drinks hot for 24 hours. I was very excited when I recieved it. I was impressed until I used it.  I was very disappointed in this thermos. To my surprise the soup was cold!  I used it a second time and heated the soup extremely hot before putting it in the thermos and again the soup got cold. It's not what I expected for a nissan thermos!,0
936,"This item is far superior than the pitcher - you can fill it about four times to get as much water in the container and then you are good to go!  No need to have space in the door, just space on the shelf.  Love it!",1
937,I bought this to set a timer so I wouldn't leave the dog out too long. It's perfect!  I need the loud long alarm.  Three beeps on the microwave wasn't working.  Dog is very grateful.,1
938,"I believe if you exhibit a photo for an item on Amazon, it should be what you are to receive. Stupidly, I purchased this item based on that. I thought I was getting one of each design as pictured. I was intensely disappointed when I opened my shipping box today. By the time I send the item back, pay postage on that and order a different item, well, as long as this one took to show up in the first place, it would not be worth the time or money. I realize what mistake I made in not paying attention to the title of Round Egg Rings but the culpability flows both ways. Change the photo please!The item itself looks to be fine but is only half what is actually advertised.",0
939,"A family member purchased a new Saeco Classico Stainless Steel Espresso and Cappuccino Machine for us two years ago for Christmas and it has been a nightmare. After three months the machine stopped working and after several attempts to reach Saeco we received a Return Authorization Form. We sent the machine back to Saeco, at our cost, and they did not fix it properly. We then re-returned the machine to Saeco, again after receiving another return authorization form and again at our cost, and the same machine was returned to us.  The Espresso machine has never really worked right and Saeco refused to send us a new one even after many telephone calls and a conversation with the supervisor.   <br /> <br />Just today, I tried to use the machine which I periodically do since it cost $400 and I was lucky today as it worked but now the inside pipes (or something) seem to have corroded and specks of black/ gold are coming out into the espresso cups.....I can honestly say that this is the worst gift we have ever received. Please do not give this machine to anyone you like!     <br />",0
940,I surprised my daughter with with roaster for Christmas.  Her old one was 8 years old and had rust spots.  She loves it.,1
941,the ideal is great<br /><br />That product is not.<br /><br />Colman at walmart has a good one. No microwaveable but if you preheat it. It is still steaming at 6 hours.,0
942,It's ok not quite what I expected its kinda clumsy :( & the butter melts then falls into the water,0
943,Works great for large parties. You can store any unused salt & sugar but you must clean the lemon or lime juice tray.,1
944,"I started using Salt City Candles about 12 years ago and I have yet to find a candle that puts out such clean, exact scents.  But this about lilac - that magical, sweet, spring scent that drives every woman I know crazy.  THIS IS THE BEST LILAC SCENT YOU WILL EVER FIND!  Buy the large size, it burns forever.  It is extremely difficult to find good lilac scent - search no more - you have found it in Salt City Garden Lilac candles!",1
945,"Seems obvious now; but when I ordered these I didn't notice that they were silicone, meaning flexible. Not being made of a hard plastic like a standard ice cube tray, these are very difficult to fill with water. The finished product turns out fine, just a pain to refill completely (to create a full sphere) without spilling all over. Would not recommend or buy again.",0
946,"To begin with, this French Press does make good coffee.  It is much better if you use a courser grind so you really need to either have a coffee grinder available or shop specifically for a courser grind.<br /><br />The press is simple to use.  Add a bit of water, add  your coffee and make a slurry...then add the rest of your water, let it set for about five minutes and press.  I have found that this press leaves fewer bits of grind in the final drink than many like products.<br /><br />I love the \\""vintage\\"" look to this thing.  It is made of stainless steel but the detailing, right down to the neat looking bolts attaching the handle look rather authentic.  The double wall allows the coffee to stay otter than the traditional glass press.<br /><br />It should be noted that this makes great tea also.",1
947,"It looks really awesome. You can see some blue inserts on Amazon pictures, but actually it comes completely black, as you can see on the other customer photos. Very simple to use, you don't even need any instructions. You won't regret",1
948,"The wood was fairly rough and the slots were cut but not finished.  I was disappointed with the quality of the product but in the end it still stirs things and there are holes in the spoon so it fulfills its function.  Also \\""Made in China\\""",0
949,Did not cut properly it was very slow cutting as if it was real dull. Too much pressure had to be applied for it to work. I returned the knife. Do not recommend.,0
950,"I bought four Fat Daddio's pans -- 1 pie (9\\"") and 3 loaf (5 1/2\\"" X 3 1/8\\"" X 2 3/8\\"").  When new, the pans sport a light color and a smooth finish, akin to fresh aluminum foil.  Before using, I put them through the dishwasher.  One automatic wash later, the pie pan color can best be described as mottled and close to charcoal gray.  Also changed is the finish, now rough, no longer smooth.  The three loaf pans look relatively unchanged, although the outside of the pans seems duller than the inside.    It's my first experience with anodized aluminum.  While I'm unsure if the slight change to the loaf pans is normal, I'm certain the pie pan transformation is completely contrary to promoted claims.  The pie pan is now awaiting trash pickup.  As for the loaf pans, I'm wary enough to keep them away from the dishwasher.      [...]",0
951,"The waffle iron broke after a few months of light use. The locking mechanism is plastic, and eventually the rising waffles busted the thin plastic lock. It is also difficult to clean.",0
952,These stands are what I was looking for.  They are sturdy and easy to use and stow away.  Shipping was fast and complete.  I would use them again in the future.,1
953,I purchased 4 & 3 of them repeatedly failed to close properly or to pop back open when closed. I want to keep the one that works and return the 3 that don't work. I asked for this and don't understand what you want me to do. Please call me.,0
954,I use these cups everyday. They are great for anything.  The different colors are great too because you know who's is who's.,1
955,"Bought this earlier today as my 9 year old Hamilton Beach shaver broke and can't find another in stock anywhere (February in Alberta, Canada and not too many of these being purchased at the time, lol).  Looks awesome and kids were pumped when they saw it after I picked them up from school.  Worked for maybe 5 seconds and then jammed and made a whirring noise.  Tried everything and all manners of reassembling the shaving bowl but as in other reviews it just wouldn't work as I believe ice was getting stuck.  Kids were very disappointed needless to say.  Taking back to the store I bought it from tomorrow and ordering on-line the Hamilton Beach one that gave me 9 years of great service.  1 week delivery time (and half the price) but at least I know I'll get a reliable product.  Major disappointment, especially because it looked so great!!!!",0
956,"A+ transaction, fast and well packed shipping, condition as described. A must accessory for your mixer. The two sided spatula edging really helps mix cake and other thin batters but will not work well w/ thick cookie dough. The whip or the hook that comes w/ the mixer is best for that.",1
957,Doesn't work properly! what a waste of money. double or may be tripple time is needed to chop onions and so much force is required. absolutely hate it,0
958,"I'm sure this is a great product. I took a chance even though the numbers didn't match, the pic looked the same. It just didn't fit my mini processor well. Had to order direct from Cuisinart.",0
959,"This machine is easy to use, and I like the rectangular pan (my old machine had a square pan).",1
960,"I bought this set for my daughter who loves to bake cookies but didn't feel complete because she was lacking something.. Now her cookies comes out perfect to her imagination.. Just remember to hand clean them after use and dry completely before storing, after-all they are metal.",1
961,"The small size is nice and that's why I'm willing to give it two stars. Otherwise, it takes too long for anything to cook. To be more exact: It takes more than double the amount of time to cook anything. A one minute item takes 2 1/2 minutes to cook, a 2 minute item takes 5 minutes to cook and so on.",0
962,It came dented and did not whistle. The color is off too from the picture.,0
963,Frozen fruit and vegetables makes for a thick drink,1
964,"Great Bowl, heats well and the price is a no brainer. My order came on time if not a day earlier. The color that came is more of a reddish orange. Fits my KM and Kaloud Lotus perfectly. Stands up to long sessions of Tangiers.",1
965,works great,1
966,"These are for my son's 21st birthday, I know he will love them, they look awesome and are nice and heavy!",1
967,"Disappointed...the holes on the steamer basket are WAY too large! When peas, corn, beans, etc. fall through to the bottom they burn which effects the remaining veggies in the top portion.  I purchased this because 1) it was stainless (my former one was aluminum, which I am trying to avoid for cooking) and 2) I planned to use it more often for steaming veggies than cooking rice.  It also does not include instructions for the recommended amount of rice/water so it is a guessing game!  I do leave the steam basket on the top of the bowl when cooking rice, as another reviewer recommended, and it helps to prevent overflow. Also, I wish it automatically kicked off when done....it remains on &#34;warm&#34; which is a bit too warm and continues to cook the rice or smells like it is burning if steaming veggies.",0
968,good,1
969,"Doesn't open all cans. If the can has a slightly high lip on the rim, it won't open it. Not as impressed as the other people who wrote reviews.",0
970,I wish it stayed on longer.  Can't really do anything with it on.  Just driving made it rub off.,0
971,These were very bad quality. Don't seal in the bottle so leak badly!,0
972,"The servers' \\""bowl-shaped\\"" parts are too flat to actually \\""scoop\\"" up salad and the very flat design (no arc to the servers) doesn't help either.",0
973,"Best one I&#34;ve used. I own three which I sometimes use simultaneously if serving company. Easy clean-up. NEVER had a problem with batter sticking. Alway even cooking.  I preheat the waffle iron while making the batter and time each batch for 3-3.5 minutes. Would give it five stars if the indicator lights were in any way useful. I use the standard Krusteaz waffle mix from Costco, augmented with a whole egg and an extra half Tablespoon olive oil per batch. Frequently I fill the mix with diced fruit--peaches, nectarines, blueberries, strawberries. Still no problem with sticking. Great product, but manually time each batch.",1
974,"I love it! It is smaller than most toaster ovens, attractive, easy to use, efficient crumb tray and easily removed for cleaning.  It has a sense of humor too, with an &#34;a bit more&#34; button to press to toast for 30 seconds more!",1
975,"Sturdy, easy to use and clean. Thick plastic, easy to open and fits snuggly in to the base for freezing.",1
976,Old school popper that worked as expected right out of the box!,1
977,"Frozen fruit will stay put at the top, but other than it works perfectly.  Having smoothies everyday is awesome.",1
978,"This is the third or forth time that I replaced this order. I'm still experiencing the same problem that the filter cracks and leaks. Normal usage, always leave inside my apartment, never leave it in a car or expose to the sun but within two use there's a huge crack.",0
979,"Even though these kinds of candelabras are a bit outdated, my wife wanted one just for the fun of having something so elegant.  It is beautiful and looks better than the picture online.  If you're looking for something like this, look no further.  A great deal even if it were at twice the price...",1
980,"This was the most amazing pan I had ever used, for about 9 months.  Then suddenly everything stuck to it.  Even oil stuck to it!  What a disappointment.  The ceramic coating is so thin, it wears off, even if you take great care not to overheat.  Don't buy it.",0
981,"I give this 2 stars because the case is nice, but it took way to long to arrive, the stylus was bent,  didn't receive my cleasing cloth and I though I was getting a screen protector (which I didn't receive) unless I misunderstood.",0
982,"I took a risk ordering this for a birthday present, see that some of the other reviews complaining that lettering had issues.  I figured that Titan would have seen the reviews and corrected the mistake, but apparently they didn't.  The M was smeared in &#34;CALM&#34; and there's no way I can give this coffee mug as a present.  Unfortunately, I have to send this back.",0
983,"I bought this to save some time when it comes to preparing sweet potatoes and carrots and whatnot. Prior to purchasing I would use the 2 mm slicing blade twice(cutting things into slices then slicing perpendicular) to julienne veggies.<br /><br />This disc makes a few good julienne slices but then the blade gets bogged down and turns the rest to mush. I'll just stick with the extra step from now on.<br /><br />It might work better with potatoes, I guess we will see.",0
984,They are all completely rusted now. I can't use them anymore.,0
985,"The handle is not nearly rigid enough.  Best to rest it on the receiving vessel instead of hold it by the handle.  The wood insert falls out easily, compounding the rigidity problem.  I bought two, and both have the same issue.",0
986,"The blades aren't sharp enough, the herbs just end up munged up and stuck in between them. Wasn't even able to cut up basil.",0
987,Hated this. I do not like the oversized European proportions. Seems most stainless is moving in this direction. I had a difficult time finding flatware in the old traditional American size. I was also less than impressed with the detailing. It seemed &#34;faint&#34; to me.,0
988,"Unlike the older pressure cookers, the lid is attached to the pan in very strange design. Especially when it is hot, the lid is super hard to manage.",0
989,"This is a very beautiful book, especially the covers.  It's well made and has a really nice feel to it.  The paper inside is beautiful too.  It's rough and handmade, not like regular cold-press drawing paper, so it's a little difficult to write/draw on in comparison from the texture - it doesn't erase well.  But it's a lovely book.",1
990,I bought three with a sippy cup top for my toddler...within a few days she had scratched off the outside PAINT by chewing on it with her baby teeth...big flakes of pink paint are missing and the rest is flaking off.  I just read its made in China and now I'm freaking out.  DO NOT BUY this bottle for kids!!! Even if its marketed with a bottle or sippy lid!!!  I will be trying to contact the company.,0
991,"DOES NOT FIT IN BUNN VP-17. It shows that it is designed to go with the BUNN, but the base of the carafe thermos is too large and will not sit inside the thermal plate recess of the BUNN. Comercial BUNN has screws on the permiter of the hot plate, this carafe is wider than the recess a normal glass pot sets in and it sits on the screws unevenly. It will not center under the filter basket because of this.<br /><br />Yes, it will work. But the product description is misleading because it gives the impression that the carafe is designed to work seamlessly with a BUNN unit when in fact due to the large size of the base it does not work like standard pots and it is clumsy.<br /><br />I am highly disappointed because this is a huge oversight that is not told in the sales pitch.<br /><br />Other than that it is a great unit!  I will keep it because it is probably the best one, but I will always have to deal with its clumsiness in my BUNN. It is a blight on a otherwise perfect system.",0
992,"If you think you are getting something like a Tervis, you will be VERY let down.  They both leaked the first time they were used.  Do yourself a favor and buy a true Tervis.  These are terrible.",0
993,The glass is poor quality with warped lines.  The had many bubbles and flaws in the glass as well.  The looked terrible! Nothing like what is pictured.,0
994,"I use it all the time, but it's pink not purple....I was ok with that",1
995,The single cup brewer side worked for a couple of days and then broke.  Hamilton Beach is in the process of replacing the unit. HB Customer Service was easy to communicate with and asked clear questions and gave clear instructions.  I am satisfied  with Customer Service.,0
996,It is advertised that it will work even in the new 2.0 brewers.  It will not.  I even called keurig and they said it will not nor will any reusable work in the new 2.0 brewers.,0
997,"After 7 days, the clicker went and hasnt worked since. Worst $18 i've ever spent .",0
998,"The material is very stiff, and it's very difficult (basically impossible) to get all the air out of the bag. This means that the bag tends to float above the hot water. Sub-optimal.<br /><br />Not poisoning yourself is a nice idea in theory, but these bags are a real pain to use.",0
999,"beautifull ,good price for very high Quality",1
