The first time I asked for a power unit replacement that I was willing to pay, but they said don't provide separately.<br />The second time I claimed a replacement for the unit if the warranty was still valid. The slow answering customer support just sought an easy way out to void the warranty. At the same time, I also hired two technicians but they were unable to fix it.<br /><br />The grinder looks good and it's easy to operate. However, there's a high probability that it won't work with oily or sticky beans. Therefore, unless you plan to grind cinnamon roast beans don't bother buying it, because the customer support experience isn't really worth the price.",

I tried placing the lid in boiling water for 5 minutes, but it didn't help. If the manufacturer came out with a new lid that didn't smell, I'd be first in line to purchase one.<br /><br />I'd also like to mention that I was surprised that it didn't keep my coffee hot for very long. I certainly expected it to, for two reasons; glass is a good insulator and the mug is double walled. I think the heat escapes mainly from the thin rubber lid which isn't insulated at all. Again, a redesigned lid would be a great addition to the aesthetically appealing mug.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that if I had it to do over again and I knew what I know now, I'd look elsewhere.",

I haven't oiled it at all and the Arepas don't stick. It cooks at one temperature.  Plug it in and it turns on, unplug and it turns it off...all of these type of gadgets seem to work the same way.<br /><br />If this keep working, it's a good little investment on just the Areaps.  No standing over a hot stove during this heatwave.<br /><br />***Over a year later and it still works.  I can't use it as much since I need to watch my carbs due to health so it isn't getting used as much, now.  I still do make my gluten-free items with this, on occasion - mini brownies and cakes turn out beautifully.  Muffin mix makes portioned sized 'cookie' shapes, flat on one side, domed on the other.

You can only put a VERY SMALL piece of parmesan in the grater.  Maybe enough for two people's pasta or risotto.  NOt v convenient when serving any more than two.  You have to hold it up to grate the cheese, can't just grate over a plate and stop when you have enough. It doesn't stay shut, so you can't store it in fridge with cheese. (I guess why would you when the space for cheese is tiny, but that was what I did with my old one.)  And even when you put it on a plate to rest on table, the tiny piece of cheese falls out.

That was a factor in our getting the oven and because of that we ordered a 12 inch pizza stone with it.  When the items arrived we tried to fit the stone in the oven.  NO GO.  The stone was WAY too big for the oven.  So, I removed the stone and got out my trusty analog wooden ruler, which I deftly inserted into the front opening of the machine and moved it back as far as it would go which was...10 inches.  The shelf is BARELY 10 inches deep front to back!!!  From side to side the shelf is BARELY 12 1/4\\\\\" wide.  So dear reader, DO NOT TAKE the measurements offered on Amazon's website at face value.<br /><br />If you want to do 12 inch pizza's in this oven you will have to use a stone/pan that is rectangular and no more than 10\\\\\" x12\\\\\"<br /><br />While I do not know the reasons for mess up by Amazon, I am going guess that *possibly* something has been lost in translation between metric measures (Breville is a Quebec company and Canada is on the Metric system)and the old-fashioned English measures used in the US.  Just a guess.<br /><br />If you're intent on baking 12 inch ROUND pizza's you will have to get the largest Breville oven to do it.  That is, if you can trust Amazon's measurements on THAT oven....????  In the meantime Amazon should stop showing 12 inch circular pans/stones as accessories for this toaster oven!",

The first toaster I bought was a Black & Decker model for about $40. It was so terrible at making toast I returned it instantly and got this KitchenAid model.<br /><br />First of all, the design is nice. It's solid and looks good. It 'works' nicely. However it does NOT toast toast evenly. It ALWAYS toasts one side more than the other no matter what slot you put it into. The different setting do make a noticeable change in toasting, but still, the uneven cooking is present. The other annoying thing about this toaster is it beeps 3 times when the toast pops up. Why 3 times? It's so loud and high pitched it actually hurts your ears! You can't disable it, or even muffle it. I returned the thing and got another to make sure I didn't get a lemon. Same thing exactly. So I returned that one too.<br /><br />Hey KitchenAid and all other toaster makers. If you can't make a toaster that ACTUALLY toasts CORRECTLY, then maybe you shouldn't be making toasters! OR, is it you fail to have any quality control on these items that are being pumped out of China? Toast doesn't take rocket science to make. a $15 toaster should make great toast. A $70 toaster should make PERFECT toast! I'm tired of buying junk products that these companies put out. My old GE toaster that was 30 years old and I think it only cost about $20, but it made PERFECT toast and it looked nice. Simple but nice.

These look like they should be heavy but are not.  My 12 oz beer glasses are heavier (the type that come 4 in a box and found in every bar across America type).  I disagree with the reviews that suggest these are too big to hold comfortably- they do feel substantial in your hand but not so much that I can not hold on to it-  a child may have issues holding it but these weren't meant to be serving juice to kids.<br /><br />Another point to note, they have a minimalist look to them- since they are double rocks glasses they are short and look \\\\\"squaty\\\\\" maybe even a little out of proportion.  But if you consider these are 13.5 oz glasses that are just as tall as a regular low-ball glass they will require a larger diameter and thus be a little \\\\\"squaty\\\\\".  The pictures do not do a great job revealing this to the consumer but to those that know what they are looking at this is no surprise.  To a novice like me, it's different,  but I do not know how you would make a 13.5 oz glass look any better while still being true to what a \\\\\"double rocks\\\\\" glass is suppose to be.<br /><br />Rim and wall are thin- I compared these to my older (and cheaper) rocks glass and the zwiesel glasses are thinner.  However, these are cyrstal and not pressed glass so expectations should be different.  I've put these in the dishwasher without issue.<br /><br />The  4 star rating is specifically due to the shortcomings in the weight - however,  I am happy with the purchase and recommend them to somebody that liked this look- but if they specifically want a heavy glass and were not concerned about the actual amount/size of the glass (not really caring if they were double sized)- then I would not suggest these as a first choice there maybe others out there that fit that bill better.<br /><br />**Extended use Update***<br />I've had those glasses of overa year and lost two to the dishwasher - I suspect due to the thin glass.  While I still like them I have to take off another star due to their frailty.  We have the cheaper cut crystal glasses that you can get at and better department store that come from somewhere in Europe - not overly expensive probably $4 a glass and a lot smaller than these and they have held up for 13 years and counting with hundreds of washings in the dishwasher and by hand.  While they are an old pattern and not as cool as these- they have certainly paid for themselves in terms of cost per use.  I wouldn't buy these Schott Zweisel again and the ones I have left I'll have to hand wash to preserve their life.  I would no longer recommend them and the two stars are because they say they are dishwasher safe (hard to agree with because of the thinner glass).  Common sense really says wash by hand and you'll be ok but when compared to the ones if had at better bars, these fall short in weight and durability and when compared to my old cut style cheaper crystal that have taken a beating for 13+years these also fall short.  Therefore, now it's only 2 stars.",

The acronym sounded familiar. What was PTFE?<br /><br />A quick search of Wikipedia provided the answer: [...]<br /><br />As Wikipedia explains:<br /><br />Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a fluoropolymer discovered by Roy J. Plunkett (1910-1994) of DuPont in 1938. It was introduced as a commercial product in 1946 and is generally known to the public by DuPont's brand name TeflonÂ®.<br /><br />Huh? Teflon? Wait a minute. Didn't the Swiss Diamond website just claim that the product contained no Teflon?<br /><br />If you look back at the Swiss Diamond website screen capture, the careful wording of their answer now becomes clear. It states, \\\\\"The Swiss Diamond coating does not contain any Teflon taking into consideration that \\\\\"Teflon\\\\\" is a trade mark, made and owned by DUPONT.\\\\\"<br /><br />So the pans don't contain Teflon, they just contain the chemical called Teflon. It's like saying a nuclear warhead doesn't contain any plutonium, it only contains nuclear fissionable material.<br /><br />For the manufacturer to insist the Swiss Diamond pans contain no Teflon whatsoever when it is made primarily from polytetrafluoroethylene, the chemical widely known as Teflon, is extremely deceptive. In fact, the intent of the Swiss Diamond company seems to be to deceive consumers by omission of the facts. The FAQ document on the Swiss Diamond website, for example, does not bother to say something like, \\\\\"But our pans do contain PTFE, the chemical known as Teflon.\\\\\" It simply insists they contain no Teflon and moves on to the next question.<br /><br />It seems that Swiss Diamond goes out of its way to give the impression that this product is free of Teflon chemicals and is surfaced primarily with diamonds. That's the impression I got, anyway, and I read the promotional materials several times before purchasing the pan.<br /><br />Consumers have been hoodwinked yet again, in the name of corporate interests ,and BIG money, for the filthy rich executives who produce obscenely overpriced products and sell them to trusting consumers.y to give the impression that this product is free of Teflon chemicals and is surfaced primarily with diamonds.
