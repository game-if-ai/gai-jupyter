      "Rhinestones on hoodie were a nice surprise but they have already started becoming loose and getting lost. As a matter of fact one stone was  hanging off when it arrived. Be that as it may I will purchase again as the quality is very good and the jacket very beautiful. I had to obtain some fabric glue and I'll soon purchase some rhinestones to replace the lost ones.",

      "Bought this popper to replace my old West Bend Stir Crazy - the old version that is a bit bigger.  The lid was cracking pretty badly on that one after many years of use. When I saw this one at Target I was excited about the on/off switch and studier looking lid so I bought it immediately.  The first batch of popcorn popped about 2/3 of the kernels that I put in, so I tried again and only about 1/4 of kernels popped. Tried a third time and again only about 1/4 of the kernels popped.  What a disappointment!  I am returning it and just ordered my old faithful stir crazy.",

I first ordered the round mold that comes in a tray. It says it's 2.5 inches wide but it wasnt. I returned it and came across this. It is what it says it is. And best priced too so far here in Amazon. I'll order a few more boxes to giveaway as gifts. Thanks Live Inz!!!",

      "The Sistema Slimline Quaddie definitely has some issues, but it's still a good product. Unlike many of the previous users, I purchased this lunchbox for personal use (as an adult who packs her lunch for work every day).<br /><br />The first thing you should know  is that this box is pretty big. I'm not sure about the other customers using this box for packing their child's lunch, but that must be a hearty lunch! The second most important thing is that the four individual sections do not seal. They do keep food contained within the container, but they aren't airtight or watertight. Liquids will quickly leak out of the box, and bread will become stale if you make a sandwich the night before.  I own other Sistema products (love their containers for baked goods) and they all seal completely, but this isn't true of their lunch products. I haven't used the mini water bottle yet as it's just a bit too small for an adult. Cleaning is a bit awkward, but I haven't had any issues (the top sections sort of slide out of little grooves and can be washed separately from the main container which I usually hand wash because it collects water in the dishwasher).<br /><br />As a lunchbox, the Slimline Quaddie is excellent. It stores food easily and keeps your lunch items separate. I usually pack my food in individual ziplock bags then put them in the box. Thick liquids such as hummus seem to stay well contained without bags, although I usually tuck the entire box into a gallon sized plastic bag just in case. The bottom section is very spacious (although not very tall) and allows me to carry full sized silverware in my lunch. If you pack salads for lunch you will love the bottom section for packing and eating lettuce (loose lettuce with dressing and toppings in a ziplock). Having separate sections also encourages you to pack a balanced lunch.<br /><br />The only real problem that I have with the box is that it can be both too big and too small at the same time. I rarely manage to completely fill any of the sections, and larger  items like containers of yogurt won't fit anywhere. I haven't yet found plastic Tupperware small enough to fit in any of the sections.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with the box. It keeps food nicely contained and doesn't allow anything to get smashed. Can you do the same thing with individual Tupperware in a paper bag?  Yes, but it doesn't look as neat.etely fill any of the sections, and larger  items like containers of yogurt won't fit anywhere.

      "This headboard does not fit the bed frame.  I ordered the 12 drawer bed frame and head board.  The frame is too wide to fit between the moldings on the front of the headboard.  If you cut the molding, you will expose the unfinished edge and it will look like crap.  If you have a standard metal bed frame, it might fit, I don't know.  But if you bought the 12 drawer frame, and probably the 6 drawer, it will not be wide enough.",

      "Silicone baking cups are better for the environment since you can re-use them time after time. You simply line a muffun tin with these cups and bake away. Makes it easy to clean up your muffin tin too.The molds are super flexible, so it makes it easy to get cupcakes out. They are non stick, so you don't lose as much to the \\\\\"wrapper\\\\\" as you would with paper molds. They wash easily in the dishwasher, so makes cleanup a breeze. The one problem I have is that I only have 12, so I'm gonna need to buy more to bake cupcakes for my daughter's birthday party. I do like that they are different colors, so I can bake different kinds of cupcakes within the same batch and know exactly what I put into them (provided I write down what I put  in them to begin with). These are handy to have and something that is useful. I also use these as ingredient holders when I'm preparing baking mixtures or recipes. They work well to hold my sugar, salt, butter, etc., until i'm ready to mix the ingredients together. I must admit, we also used these during sushi night to put soy sauce in since our soy sauce bowls broke during a move.",

      "I'm greatly disappointed with this purchase.  I got took!  I was expecting something like nearly new for $159.00, and what I received was an old very used coffee pot.  It takes 20 minutes to brew a pot, and the lettering is nearly worn off of the front.  The warming tray is very worn. This item would sell for no more than $20.00 at a flee market.  I'm disabled and my funds are precious and so I'm greatly disappointed. I though that this purchases seemed pricy but it was the only ones I could find and being through Amazon I trusted it was good.  At least it works!  First time I have been taken on Amazon!",

Don't let the name Cuisinart fool you, most of their products are good, pricey, but good.  This one is not good.  All the popcorn does not pop, some is left in the popper when it is done, even when I leave it on for an extra long time and risk burning the kernels.  In addition to that, unpopped kernels come out during the whole popping process and I used a premium popping corn.  And, yes, the popcorn and kernels fly all over the place and I used a great big bowl.",

It is my &#34;go to&#34; pan for just about everything.  I can't praise it enough.  I own two 10&#34; pans, paying only $60.00 at another chef's site (hint), but they are worth twice the price.

It is just slightly flexible but works fine.<br />There are also comments about the sharp drinking edge and this is a concern but easily repairable.  Only the inside edge is a problem.  Put some masking tape around the outside to protect from scratches.  Take a 1&#34; x 2&#34; piece of 150 grit sandpaper and with your thumb sand down the inside sharp edge only.  Then take a 1&#34; x 2&#34; piece of 400 wet dry and polish the inside edge.  Makes a world of difference on sensitive lips!!  Just love these glasses now.  Just fill with your favorite wine and enjoy without the risk of broken glass around the pool, on the tile deck, etc..<br /><br />Purchased mine from &#34;Clearly Acrylic&#34; who was a wonderful, prompt supplier that responded quickly to email questions with helpful responses.

They insisted that customers should pay as far as it is not under warranty \\\\"regardless if it broke down at the first time or on the first day\\\\". That tells you they have no commitment to their product quality and how relentlessly they treat their customers. I would never buy another Cusinart product and return any Cusinart gift.

It does a very good job of blending. I programmed the #2 button so that when the machine is on all I have to do is just press #2 but before the blender is through I also like to hit the far right \\\\\"faster\\\\\" button (can't remember the actual name of the button) just to make the end product creamier which will make it run up to 50 seconds longer but I just hit the off button after about ten seconds.  I am very pleased with this blender. I don't need a tamper! It does not rag on my nerves as it runs like the others do.

      "I read all the reviews and picked the Sunbeam because of that & the great price. I was very disappointed when I used the kettle. As soon as the water boiled it would leak out of the bottom of the kettle. Not a little leak but a ton of water. Not sure if I just got a bad one. Not gonna risk it, will purchase a different model.",

      "I bought two of these mugs,1 black & 1 grey. They both have the same problem,that being they're poorly designed. The lids screw on but after a few minuets of hot coffee they warp leaving you with coffee dripping down your chin and another stain-resistant shirt stained. I donated the two cups to the local landfill. Ordered another kind from amazon but the results are the same. Another stained shirt, another review.",

      "Only one cup arrived (advertised as 12). I knew they wouldn't be particularly high quality, but one of these cheap tumblers is most definitely NOT WORTH the money (~$14.12).",

      "I did a lot of research to find a decent toaster at a decent price. Deciding on this was a big mistake. The 1100 watts was misleading as it was very slow to toast. I had it replaced under warrantee, and that wasn't much better. Then, within about 5 months, the catch mechanism broke (for the lever which holds the toast down) as others had reported. For me, a total waste of time and money.  I just ordered a Kitchen Aid, thought I should pass this along.",

      "Stay away from this product. I bought the Melitta 10 Cup thermal Coffee Maker Model # 46894 because I was looking for a 10 cup and for the most part it had good reviews, even though I saw some reviews that claimed it did not keep the coffee warm. Well now I know why. The warmer plate automatically turns off after brewing the coffee rather than the 2 hour auto-off feature. In addition to that the water reservoir leaked and left puddles on the counter top. This purchase was a total waste of my time and energy. I sent an e-mail to Melitta customer service and they never responded. If I could give it less than one star I would.",

      "After purchasing these and using them once, the molds don't hold their form anymore. This bottoms do not sit flush in the pan/griddle and egg runs out unless you hold your fingers on the mold the entire time! What a disappointment!",

      "Initially the anti-fatigue rugs seemed like it was a great purchase.  I bought two and they arrived on a Friday.  I put one in front of the kitchen sink and the other in front of the range.  I enjoyed their cushioning effect over the weekend, but on Monday morning as I rinsed my coffee cup before leaving for work, my high heel went through the cover - a hole right in my new rug! The same things happened the next morning - the rug cover cannot even support my 125 lbs!  Very disappointing purchase, unless you plan to wear only soft-soled, flat shoes.",

      "Works great! I was skeptical when I first opened it because it was plastic and very light-- It seemed cheap. I couldn't be more wrong. The light weight makes it easy to put up and take out. It's also very easy clean up. I've only made zucchini noodles so far, but I plan on making curly fry sweet potatoes tonight!",
